# Changelog

All notable user-facing and architectural changes. The current line is
unreleased; tag versions get a date when they ship.

## 1.4.1 — Sudoers, installer UX, wizard discoverability, maximize-all (2026-05-17)

Five user-reported friction points addressed:

**Sudoers drop-in** (`data/sudoers.d/mackes-shell`, installed at
`/etc/sudoers.d/mackes-shell` mode 0440). Grants the `wheel` group
NOPASSWD on the Mackes-managed command allowlist (dnf, systemctl,
firewall-cmd, install/cp/chown, gtk-update-icon-cache,
plymouth-set-default-theme, the Apache-archive curls birthright uses,
tee for specific config paths). Validated by `visudo -c` in `%post`;
on failure the file is removed so the host's sudo behavior is never
broken. `AdminSession.run()` short-circuits to `sudo -n` when this
drop-in is active — no prompts at all during normal Mackes
operations. The previous prompt-storm during the wizard's birthright
pipeline is gone.

**Carbon-styled installer** (`install.sh` rewrite). Each phase
renders as a Carbon banner row with a spinner: Detect Fedora →
Resolve release tag → Download RPM → Install via dnf → Hand off to
wizard. The dnf transaction streams its output as Carbon-dimmed
lines instead of going dark for several minutes. Logs to
`/tmp/mackes-install.*.log` for triage.

**Always-visible Setup button in the header** — next to the Help
button. Opens the wizard regardless of `state.provisioned`. The
hidden "Re-open Wizard" inside the Tweaks drawer stays for muscle
memory.

**Birthright health check** (`mackes/birthright_check.py`): 12 probes
that verify each apply_* step's on-disk artifacts (theme dirs, IBM
Plex packages, Plymouth theme active, sudoers drop-in present, panel
layout xfconf, RPM/AppImage app presence, xrdp + Guacamole config,
ansible-pull timer enabled, Conky config + autostart, maximizer
service, Flathub remote, third-party repos). `is_complete()` returns
True only when all 12 pass.

**Always-maximize windows** (12th birthright). A new user-level
service `mackes-maximizer.service` polls `wmctrl -l` once per second
and adds `maximized_vert`/`maximized_horz` to every new top-level
window. Exempt classes: `xfce4-panel`, `xfdesktop`, `mackes-conky`,
`Plymouth`. RPM Requires `wmctrl` + `xorg-x11-utils` (for `xprop`).
Disable per-user via `~/.config/mackes-shell/maximizer.disabled`.

## 1.4.0 — Debloat tiers, TUI, Splash, Conky HUD, Session unlock, full Carbon (2026-05-17)

Seven user-driven additions plus the Carbon-completion pass that finishes
the design assimilation started in v1.1.x.

### Carbon completion

The two items deferred at the original v1.4.0 cut window are now done:

**Legacy panels** (`mackes/workbench/_common.py`): rewrote the shared
helpers (`panel_box / title_label / info_label / section_header /
labeled_row / error_label`) to emit Carbon-refresh widgets. Single-file
change cascades across **every** legacy panel that imported these
helpers — Devices / System / Network (Wi-Fi, VPN, QNM, Firewall) /
Help — without per-panel rewrites. Old v1.0 CSS class names are kept
alongside the new ones, so no CSS rule regressions.

**Carbon-native wizard window** (`mackes/wizard/window.py`): replaced
`Gtk.Assistant` with a custom `Gtk.ApplicationWindow` matching the
sidebar shell's chrome. Top: 9-step progress strip with active
indicator. Center: a `Gtk.Stack` of page widgets (welcome / env-scan /
preset-pick / appearance / hardware / network / snapshot / review /
apply / summary). Bottom: a Carbon action bar (Back / Cancel / Next or
Apply or Continue or Finish, depending on the active step's kind).
Existing page builder modules drop in unchanged — they were already
Carbon-styled inside. The PROGRESS step auto-launches the apply
pipeline on first activation, then unlocks the Continue button. The
SUMMARY step's Next button becomes "Finish" which destroys the window
and unblocks `do_activate` → opens the Dashboard.

### Features

**Conky HUD** (`mackes/conky_hud.py`, `data/conky/`, 11th birthright):
top-right Carbon-themed desktop panel (400 × ⅔ screen height) with
live Mackes-platform state. Opaque Carbon Gray 90 fill with a 3px
accent left-edge that swaps with the active preset. Birthright step
`apply_conky` installs the package + writes the user config + the XDG
autostart entry, then bounces the process. Tweaks panel gains a
"Show Conky HUD" switch under Chrome that flips both the autostart
file and the running process.

Tiered refresh per Q3 lock — `update_interval=1.0` for the system
built-ins (clock, CPU, RAM, load), `${execi 30 ...}` for Mackes-state
queries (mesh / fleet / drift / notifications / media services /
remote sessions / services dot-grid), `${execi 60 ...}` for shared
storage (rare changes).

Ten content blocks per Q4 lock: Header (version + preset + admin
lock), Mesh (peers + control node), Fleet (last pull + 24h failures),
Drift (items differing from preset), Shared storage (QNM-Shared
usage), Global notifications (mesh + local counts + latest), Media
services (Jellyfin/Plex/Airsonic/etc. across peers), Remote desktop
(active RDP/VNC + Guacamole connections), Services (sshd / headscale
/ tailscaled / guacd / tomcat / mackes-remote-sync / mackes-ansible-pull
/ caddy as a compact dot grid), Hardware (hostname / CPU / RAM / load
/ clock).

Helper scripts under `data/conky/helpers/*.sh` — one per block. Each
shells out to either a Mackes Python module (mesh / fleet / drift /
media) or pure shell (storage / notifications / remote / services).

Spec **Requires: conky** so birthright never finds the package missing.
The Conky preset accent live-swaps via `conky_hud.restart_with()`
called from the shell's `_apply_tweaks()` whenever the preset changes.

### Features

**Wizard boot splash** (`mackes/wizard/splash.py`): plays
`branding/MACKES-XFCE-LOGO.mp4` (H.264 1280×720, 8s, AAC audio muted)
as a borderless centered window before the first-run wizard surfaces.
Skippable via click / Escape / any key; auto-dismisses on
end-of-stream. Falls back silently if GStreamer or its H.264 decoder
isn't installed. The pipeline uses GStreamer `playbin` + the X11
`VideoOverlay` XID-embed pattern (gtksink isn't packaged in stock
Fedora 44 GStreamer, but `xvimagesink`/`ximagesink` are).
Spec Recommends: `gstreamer1`, `gstreamer1-plugins-{base,good,bad-free}`,
`mozilla-openh264`, `gstreamer1-plugin-openh264`. All Recommends not
Requires so headless nodes don't carry the codec stack.
MANIFEST.in extended to include `*.mp4` / `*.webm` under `branding/`
so the video survives the sdist round-trip into the RPM.

**Debloat levels** (`mackes/debloat.py`, `Maintain → Debloat levels`):
five cumulative tiers (L1 Light → L5 Viable). Each tier is an
idempotent `dnf remove` set plus optional xfconf resets. The panel shows
a live preview of what's currently installed vs already absent before
the user commits. Bound by a confirm modal; logs the run.

**Textual TUI** (`mackes/tui/`, autobooted on headless): runs every
screen the GUI has — Dashboard, Mesh VPN, Mesh SSH, Mesh Services,
Mesh Remote, Fleet Inventory, Fleet Playbooks, Fleet Run history,
Snapshots, Debloat, Help. Launches automatically when there's no
`$DISPLAY` and no subcommand. `python3 -m mackes --tui` forces it.

**Session unlock** (`mackes/admin_session.py`, header Lock/Unlock
button): single sign-in for the whole Mackes session. Click Unlock,
type the password once, every subsequent admin op runs without
prompting. Uses sudo's timestamp cache + a 4-min keepalive thread.
Auto-locks when the window closes. Migrated call sites:
  - `mackes/birthright.py:_run_root`
  - `mackes/workbench/network/remote_desktop.py:_run_root`
  - `mackes/debloat.py:apply_level`
  - `mackes/caddy_gateway.py:_pkexec`

**Live status bar** (`shell/sidebar_window.py:_refresh_status_bar`):
the bottom bar's mesh / services / sshd / drift counts are now live —
pulled from `service_health()`, the Headscale roster, the mesh-services
registry, and the active-preset drift detector. Refreshes every 30s.

**Live sidebar nav badges**: peer count on Mesh VPN, service count on
Mesh Services, failed-runs count on Fleet → Run history, drift-items
count on Maintain. Same 30s refresh cycle as the status bar.

**Tweaks density** finally works: compact / cozy / comfortable now
swap `.mackes-density-*` classes on the root window. CSS rules in
`carbon-layout.css` adjust nav-item heights, tile padding, and
data-table row heights accordingly.

**Toast host** (`shell/toasts.py`): bottom-right non-modal notifications
for shell-wide events. Snapshot create now uses a toast instead of a
silent status label.

### Carbon design system

`.claude/CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/skills/{mackes-worklist-management,
complete-remaining-work}/SKILL.md` — three workflow protocols ported
from `matthewmackes/map2-audio` and adapted to the mackes-shell repo.
The commit/push rulebook, single-source worklist, and autonomy policy
are now durable behavioral contracts in `.claude/`.

### Open-source project artifacts

Added the standard OSS files the repo was missing:
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — dev setup + project conventions
  - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Contributor Covenant v2.1
  - `SECURITY.md` — disclosure protocol + threat model
  - `AUTHORS` — maintainer + upstream credits
  - `.editorconfig` — line endings + indentation
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug_report,feature_request,config.yml}`
  - `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
  - `.github/FUNDING.yml`
  - `.github/dependabot.yml` (weekly Actions bumps)
  - `CITATION.cff`

### Deferred to v1.4.1

Legacy panels (`devices/*`, `system/*`, `network/{wifi,vpn,qnm,firewall}.py`)
still use the v1.0-era `workbench/_common.py` helpers — they look
inconsistent next to the v1.1.x Carbon-refresh panels. Wizard chrome is
still `Gtk.Assistant`, not a Carbon-native window. Both are tracked as
v1.4.1 work — they're substantial mechanical rewrites that don't block
the v1.4.0 functional additions.

## 1.3.0 — Mesh Fleet (Ansible-pull) (2026-05-17)

Cross-peer fleet management lands as a 10th wizard birthright step.
Ten design decisions locked via the 1.3.0 question survey:

  1. Transport: **ansible-pull** on every peer (no central controller)
  2. Playbook store: **QNM-Shared/.qnm-sync/playbooks/** (replicated by
     the existing file substrate)
  3. Install: 10th wizard step `apply_fleet` — always on
  4. Curated playbooks: 7 roles ship — system-update, bloat-removal,
     apps-install, xfconf-baseline, mesh-state-snapshot,
     selinux-permissive-toggle, container-runtime-setup
  5. Schedule: systemd timer — OnBootSec=10min,
     OnUnitActiveSec=30min, RandomizedDelaySec=5min
  6. GUI: new top-level **Fleet** sidebar group with 3 items
     (Inventory / Playbooks / Run history)
  7. Editor: read-only YAML preview + `xdg-open` to user's editor
  8. Secrets: none — playbooks are plaintext
  9. Run history: 30-day retention, one JSON per run at
     `QNM-Shared/.qnm-sync/ansible-runs/<peer>/<ts>.json`
 10. Ad-hoc: yes — Inventory has multi-select + "Run on selection"
     SSH-push over mesh-SSH identity

### What was added

**New birthright step** `apply_fleet` in `mackes/birthright.py`:
  - dnf install: ansible-core, python3-ansible-runner, podman
  - Seeds the playbook tree into QNM-Shared/.qnm-sync/playbooks/
  - Installs + enables mackes-ansible-pull.{service,timer}
  - Queues an initial pull (non-blocking)

**New module** `mackes/fleet.py`:
  - `build_inventory()` — Headscale roster → FleetPeer list with
    per-peer last-pull timestamp + 24h pull count
  - `list_playbooks()` — discovers roles under the QNM-Shared tree
  - `list_runs()` / `write_run_record()` / `prune_runs()` — full
    30-day-retention history reader/writer
  - `run_local_pull()` — local ansible-pull, parses the PLAY RECAP,
    writes a JSON record
  - `run_push()` — ansible-playbook SSH push to selected peers via
    a generated ephemeral inventory.ini
  - CLI: `python -m mackes.fleet --pull / --push / --list / --history / --prune`

**7 curated playbooks** under `data/ansible/playbooks/`:
  - system-update          (tag-gated `never`; opt-in via GUI)
  - bloat-removal          (default-tagged; runs on every cycle)
  - apps-install           (default-tagged)
  - xfconf-baseline        (default-tagged; the steady-state drift corrector)
  - mesh-state-snapshot    (tag-gated `never`)
  - selinux-permissive-toggle (tag-gated `never`)
  - container-runtime-setup (tag-gated `never`)

**Systemd units** at `data/systemd/`:
  - mackes-ansible-pull.service (Type=oneshot, ConditionPathExists
    fleet.disabled escape hatch)
  - mackes-ansible-pull.timer (30-min cycle with 5-min jitter)

**Fleet GUI** — new top-level `Fleet` sidebar group with 3 Carbon panels:

  - `mackes/workbench/fleet/inventory.py` — Carbon page header, live
    status notification, action row with Run-on-selection /
    Local-pull / Select-all-online / Clear, peer ListBox with
    checkbox + status dot + last-pull age + per-peer status tag.
    Multi-select drives the SSH-push playbook picker Modal.
  - `mackes/workbench/fleet/playbooks.py` — grid of Carbon tiles per
    playbook with description, tag chips (default / never), last-run
    summary, YAML preview, Run-now and Open-in-editor buttons.
  - `mackes/workbench/fleet/run_history.py` — stat tiles (Total /
    Successful / Failed / Changes applied), peer + playbook filters,
    Carbon DataTable of every run across the mesh. Click any row to
    see the full JSON in a Carbon Modal (timestamp, trigger, duration,
    counts, log tail).

**Spec Requires:** ansible-core, python3-ansible-runner, podman.
**Spec Recommends:** buildah, skopeo, toolbox.

## 1.2.0 — Mesh Remote Desktop (2026-05-17)

Every Mackes node now ships browser-accessible remote desktop. Five
design decisions locked via the 1.2.0 question survey:

  1. Backends: **xrdp + x11vnc on every peer** (both protocols)
  2. Topology: **every peer runs guacd + Guacamole**
  3. Auth: **none on the mesh** (firewall + mesh CA are the trust)
  4. Connection discovery: **Headscale roster auto + Mackes overrides**
  5. Enablement: **birthright — always on**

### What was added

**9th birthright step** `apply_remote_desktop` in `mackes/birthright.py`:
  - dnf install: xrdp, xrdp-selinux, x11vnc, guacd, tomcat, curl
  - Downloads guacamole-1.6.0.war from the Apache archive into
    /var/lib/tomcat/webapps/
  - Installs the noauth extension jar at /etc/guacamole/extensions/
  - Writes /etc/guacamole/guacamole.properties + a seed
    /etc/guacamole/noauth-config.xml
  - Installs an x11vnc@.service systemd template that binds to the
    mesh IP only (live :0 mirror)
  - Installs mackes-remote-sync.service (regenerates the noauth
    connection list from the Headscale peer roster every 30s)
  - Opens firewalld ports 3389 / 5900 / 8080 on the trusted zone only
  - Enables + starts: xrdp, xrdp-sesman, x11vnc@:0, guacd, tomcat,
    mackes-remote-sync

**Connection sync** `mackes/remote_desktop.py`:
  - `active_connections()` returns RDP + VNC entries per Headscale peer,
    layered with `~/.config/mackes-shell/remote-overrides.json`
    (favorite / hide / rename)
  - `rebuild_connections()` writes /etc/guacamole/noauth-config.xml
  - `sync_daemon_main()` is the systemd-managed polling loop
  - CLI: `python -m mackes.remote_desktop --list / --rebuild / --daemon`

**Caddy gateway** route added in `mackes/caddy_gateway.py`:
  `https://media.mesh/desktop/  →  http://127.0.0.1:8080/guacamole/`

**Mesh Remote panel** `mackes/workbench/network/remote_desktop.py` —
a full first-class configuration GUI matching the Carbon panel
patterns:
  - Breadcrumb + page title + subtitle + live status Notification
  - Local services grid (xrdp / x11vnc / guacd / tomcat)
  - **Display sharing** tile: enable/disable x11vnc, X display picker,
    view-only mode toggle
  - **RDP server** tile: enable/disable xrdp, Xorg vs Xvnc backend,
    max concurrent sessions
  - **Gateway** tile: Tomcat toggle + Open-in-browser button + code
    block showing the effective Caddy route
  - **Connections** Carbon DataTable with per-row Favorite / Hide /
    Rename buttons (Rename opens a Carbon Modal)
  - **Auto-discovery** tile: sync interval (10-600s) + last-sync
    timestamp display
  - **Diagnostics** tile: `systemctl status` text for all five units +
    Refresh button
  - Persists per-user prefs to `~/.config/mackes-shell/remote-desktop.json`

**Sidebar nav** gains a "Mesh Remote" entry under Network.

**Wizard** apply pipeline is now 19 steps (added "Remote desktop"
between Flathub and Mesh); review page lists the new step.

### Spec requires

The RPM now Requires xrdp / xrdp-selinux / x11vnc / guacd / tomcat /
curl. The guacamole.war + noauth jar are fetched from the Apache
archive at first-wizard-run; the RPM itself doesn't carry them.

## 1.1.1 — Carbon panel rebuilds (the rest of the design) (2026-05-17)

Picks up where 1.1.0 left off — the seven panels that were deferred at
the v1.1.0 release window are now rebuilt to match
`docs/design/v1.1.0-carbon-refresh/`:

* **Mesh SSH** (`mackes/workbench/network/mesh_ssh.py`): page-title +
  breadcrumb, live "Tailscale-SSH active on N peers" Notification, peer
  DataTable with a host-key fingerprint column, ACL hujson rendered as
  a Carbon code block with an Edit/Save/Reload toolbar, key
  distribution actions tile, audit log DataTable.
* **Mesh Services** (`mackes/workbench/network/mesh_services.py`):
  scan/refresh action row, peer filter pills, 3-column Carbon tile
  grid of discovered services (each tile shows kind tag, status dot,
  display name, peer, accent URL), unified gateway tile with a Switch
  + route-preview code block, mDNS bridge tile listing relayed types
  as Tag chips.
* **Appearance** (`mackes/workbench/look_and_feel/appearance.py`):
  rewrapped into a two-column Carbon layout — selectors on the left
  (existing xfconf bindings preserved verbatim), live preview pane on
  the right with sample window chrome + heading + body + mono command
  + Primary/Tertiary/Ghost button row + an Active Accent swatch tile
  + Design-system-lock notification.
* **Apps** (`mackes/workbench/apps/panel.py` — new unified panel):
  three Carbon tabs (Install / Remove bloat / Installed), category
  filter chips derived from the catalog, search input, grid of
  `.mackes-app-card` tiles with icon/name/desc/meta and per-tab
  action button. Replaces the three legacy `install.py` /
  `remove.py` / `installed.py` panels at the sidebar entry point.
* **Snapshots** (`mackes/workbench/maintain/snapshots.py`): Carbon
  create tile (label input + Primary button + helper line listing
  exactly what gets captured) + Carbon DataTable of existing
  snapshots (label, created timestamp, source preset, size).
  Restore opens a confirm modal; double-click also triggers restore.
* **Maintain hub** (`mackes/workbench/maintain/hub.py` — new): 12-tile
  Carbon grid replacing the old StackSidebar+Stack inner layout for
  the Maintain section. Tile click switches an inner Gtk.Stack to the
  matching sub-panel, which is wrapped with a "‹ Back to Maintain"
  link header. Drift tile and Uninstall tile carry warning/error tags
  to mirror the design.
* **Help** (`mackes/workbench/help.py`): left rail now uses the
  `mackes-side-nav` Carbon classes (consistent with the main shell);
  right pane has a Carbon breadcrumb + page-title header above the
  existing markdown TextView, which got Carbon 40px page margins.
  Topic discovery and markdown rendering unchanged.

## 1.1.0 — Carbon refresh + birthright fold (2026-05-17)

A major release. Two large changes bundled into one cut:

### 1. Carbon refresh — sidebar shell + per-preset accents

Mackes' chrome was rebuilt to match the design at
`docs/design/v1.1.0-carbon-refresh/`. The old top-tab Notebook is gone;
in its place is a Carbon UI Shell with:

- 48px header strip (brand block + Workbench/Recovery/CLI mode buttons +
  preset chip + user@host)
- 256px grouped sidebar (Workbench / Configuration / Network / Apps &
  Maintenance / Reference) with badges and live-active highlighting
- Bottom 24px status bar (mesh/services/sshd/drift/version/preset)
- A floating **Tweaks** panel (bottom-right) for live preset swap,
  density (compact/cozy/comfortable), chrome toggles, and "Re-open
  Wizard" — state persists to `~/.config/mackes-shell/tweaks.json`.

The Dashboard is now Carbon stat tiles (mesh peers / services / sshd /
drift), a service-health grid, a Carbon notification for drift, a 2x2
hardware tile grid, six tertiary-style quick-action buttons, and a
mono-styled recent-activity log.

The **Mesh VPN panel** got a new Cairo-drawn topology view — control
node at center, peers in a ring around it, animated edge pulses
travelling along, dashed lines for DERP-relayed edges, click any peer
for a right-rail detail drawer. A toggle next to the section header
swaps between the topology view and the Carbon DataTable variant.

A 5th accent preset, **Node** (Carbon Green 50 #42be65), was added for
headless / server installs.

New files: `data/css/carbon-layout.css` (sidebar / topology / tile /
modal / topology / tweaks classes), `mackes/workbench/shell/`
(sidebar_window.py + tweaks_panel.py),
`mackes/workbench/network/mesh_topology.py` (Cairo widget),
`data/css/accents/node.css`.

### 2. Birthright fold — 8 new wizard apply steps

The audit in conversation 2026-05-17 found 7 items the wizard *should*
do at first run but didn't. They're now wired in. The wizard's apply
pipeline went from 10 steps to 18:

  Snapshot → Appearance → Devices → System → Network → Panel →
  **Themes → Fonts → Apps → Panel layout → Boot splash → System update →
  Third-party repos → Flathub** → Mesh → VPN import → Menu → Finalize

- **Themes**: copy `data/themes/PadOS/` and `data/icons/Carbon/` to
  `/usr/share/themes/` and `/usr/share/icons/`; rebuild GTK icon cache.
- **Fonts**: dnf install `ibm-plex-sans-fonts` + `ibm-plex-mono-fonts`;
  rebuild fontconfig cache.
- **Apps**: process `preset.apps.install` (install_curated_set) and
  `preset.apps.remove_bloat` (remove_packages). These lists already
  existed in every preset YAML but were never run.
- **Panel layout**: write the Mackes default xfce4-panel xfconf layout
  — Whisker Menu + Docklike + spacer + systray + IBM Plex clock — and
  `xfce4-panel --restart`.
- **Boot splash**: install + activate the Mackes Plymouth theme
  (centered logo on Carbon Gray 100 with an accent progress strip);
  regenerates initrd via `plymouth-set-default-theme mackes -R`.
- **System update**: `dnf upgrade -y --refresh` (heaviest step).
- **Third-party repos**: install `fedora-workstation-repositories`
  (Chrome/Steam/NVIDIA repo files, disabled by default) plus enable
  RPM Fusion free + nonfree for the detected Fedora version.
- **Flathub**: add the per-user Flathub remote via
  `flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --user flathub …`.

All 8 are idempotent (re-runnable via Maintain → Reset to Preset) and
live in the new `mackes/birthright.py` module.

### Fixes

- `xfconf_bridge.XfconfBridge.set` int/float coercion (1.0.4
  hotfix folded in): subprocess.check_call won't accept non-string argv
  members, so int/float values now stringify before the subprocess call.
- App installer's per-app output now reads `App: installed (npm)` /
  `App: FAILED (rc=N) (npm)` instead of the always-on `rc={rc}` form.
- Cursor's stale `download.cursor.sh` URL replaced with a runtime
  resolver against `cursor.com/api/download`.
- `neofetch` (archived upstream) is installed as `fastfetch` (its
  maintained successor) under the same catalog name.

## 1.0.5 — fix Cursor + neofetch installs, clearer output (2026-05-17)

App installer fixes after observing the wizard-time install output:

    Cursor: appimage rc=1
    <urlopen error [Errno -2] Name or service not known>
    Claude Code CLI: npm install rc=0
    changed 2 packages in 2s
    neofetch: dnf install rc=1

* **Cursor**: the hardcoded `download.cursor.sh` URL was dead — Cursor
  retired that subdomain. Replaced with a runtime resolver that calls
  `https://www.cursor.com/api/download?platform=linux-x64&releaseTrack=stable`
  (which needs a non-empty User-Agent or returns 400) and pulls the
  current `downloadUrl` out of the JSON. The User-Agent is passed on
  the AppImage download request as well.

* **neofetch**: archived upstream in 2024, dropped from Fedora 44 repos.
  The catalog entry still accepts the name `neofetch` (so existing
  preset YAMLs keep working) but installs the maintained successor
  `fastfetch` instead. A separate `fastfetch` catalog entry was added
  for explicit selection.

* **Output**: per-app install lines now read `App: installed (npm)` on
  success and `App: FAILED (rc=N) (npm)` on failure instead of the
  always-on `App: npm install rc=N` form, which looked
  indistinguishable between success and failure.

## 1.0.4 — fix xfconf_bridge int/float coercion (2026-05-17)

After installing 1.0.3 and running the wizard, three provisioner steps
all failed with the same exception:

    →  Appearance
       ERROR: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not int
    →  System
       ERROR: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not int
    →  Panel
       ERROR: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not int

Root cause in `mackes/xfconf_bridge.py::XfconfBridge.set`: when `value`
was an `int` (e.g. `cursor_size`, `workspace_count`, `/notify-location`)
or a `float` and no `type_hint` was given, the code set the right
`--type` flag but forgot to stringify `value`. The `int`/`float` then
went straight into the `subprocess.check_call` argv list, which only
accepts `str | bytes | os.PathLike`, so subprocess refused it before
xfconf-query was ever invoked.

Fix: in the int branch, `value = str(int(value))`; in the float branch,
`value = repr(float(value))`. The bool/string branches already
stringified correctly; explicit-type-hint callers already get
`value = str(value)`.

Verified with a 5-call regression test (bool / int / float / str /
explicit-type-hint) — all reach subprocess with str-only argv.

## 1.0.3 — fix MackesApp import (2026-05-17)

Install + launch flow surfaced an ImportError immediately after install:

    ImportError: cannot import name 'MackesApp' from 'mackes.app'
        File "mackes/__main__.py", line 14, in <module>
            from mackes.app import MackesApp

When `mackes.app` was refactored in 1.0 to lazy-import GTK (so headless
installs don't drag GTK into memory), the `MackesApp` class moved inside
an internal `_make_gui_app()` builder function — no longer a top-level
symbol. `mackes/__main__.py` still expected the old top-level import.

Fix: `__main__.py` now delegates to `mackes.app.main(argv[1:])` directly.
The `--uninstall` / `--yes` fast-path is preserved (still handled in
__main__ so the uninstall sequence can run without going through the
GUI router). Everything else — `--gui`, `--headless`, subcommands,
auto-detection — goes through `mackes.app.main`, which already knows
how to instantiate the GUI when it needs to.

Verified: `python3 -m mackes --version` prints `mackes 1.0.3`;
`python3 -m mackes help` prints the topic list.

## 1.0.2 — headscale.service file conflict (2026-05-17)

`dnf install` failed on the v1.0.1 RPM with:

    file /usr/lib/systemd/system/headscale.service conflicts between
    attempted installs of mackes-shell-1.0.1-1.fc44.x86_64
    and headscale-0.28.0-1.fc44.x86_64

The upstream `headscale` RPM (which we Require) ships its own
`headscale.service` at the same path. We were shipping a near-identical
copy with two extra knobs (MemoryHigh/MemoryMax). Fixed by dropping our
copy from the RPM — the upstream unit is used as-is.

`data/systemd/headscale.service` stays in the source tree as a reference
template. To apply Mackes-specific resource limits at deploy time, drop
a systemd override at `/etc/systemd/system/headscale.service.d/mackes.conf`
with the desired directives.

No code changes.

## 1.0.1 — Fedora 44 dep hotfix (2026-05-17)

`curl … install.sh | bash` was failing on stock Fedora 44 because three
of the spec's `Requires:` resolved to packages that don't exist on F44
under those names. Fixed:

- `Requires: xfce4-power-manager-plugin` → `Requires: xfce4-power-manager`
  (the panel plugin ships inside the parent package as
  `libxfce4powermanager.so`; there's no separate plugin RPM)
- `Requires: sshfs` → `Requires: fuse-sshfs` (Fedora-specific name)
- `Recommends: jellyfin-media-player` → removed (not in Fedora repos;
  users install via Flathub instead). Mackes' Media-Hub discovery still
  surfaces Jellyfin servers on the mesh whether or not a local native
  client is installed.

No code changes. RPM spec + version bump only.

## 1.0.0 — "XFCE Provisioner" (2026-05-16)

### Identity
- First non-private release. "MAP2 Sub Testing" markers fully removed across
  packaging, spec, and runtime UI.
- Repositioned from "shell stack manager" to "XFCE provisioner + mesh fabric".

### The XFCE Pivot (Q1–Q20 survey)
- Retired the Polybar / Plank / Rofi / picom / dunst shell stack entirely.
  Mackes now provisions a standard XFCE shell: xfce4-panel + xfdesktop +
  xfce4-appfinder + xfce4-notifyd, with Whisker Menu as the start menu and
  Docklike Taskbar replacing Window Buttons.
- Standard panel layout: Whisker (far-left) → Docklike taskbar → systray →
  volume → power → clock (IBM Plex Sans).
- PadOS locked as the default GTK theme; other themes greyed-out in the
  Appearance picker.
- Carbon Icons (Apache 2.0) as the system-wide GTK icon theme (replaced
  the briefly-considered Clarity icons).
- IBM Plex Sans (UI) + IBM Plex Mono (monospace) replace SF Pro / JetBrains
  Mono throughout.
- `branding/standard-wallpaper.png` is the locked desktop + LightDM greeter
  wallpaper, vendored at 7.8 MB.
- Bloat list collapsed to a single combined `remove_bloat` per preset; XFCE
  extras (asunder, parole, pragha, xfburn, transmission-gtk, claws-mail,
  pidgin) added alongside GNOME-on-XFCE apps + libreoffice-*.
- `menulibre` added to install lists for hashbang / mackes / daylight.
- ssh enabled by default on every Mackes install via RPM %post.
- LightDM greeter silently configured to match preset theme/wallpaper/font.

### Carbon Design System chrome (Q-CB1–Q-CB10)
- Pixel-exact Gray 100 palette (#161616 / #262626 / #393939 / #525252 /
  #f4f4f4 / #969696 / #2d2d30).
- Carbon UI Shell layout: 48px top header + 256px left side nav + main +
  24px status bar.
- IBM Plex Sans UI / IBM Plex Mono monospace.
- Per-preset accent (hashbang-red etc.) replaces Carbon blue at every
  focus/highlight surface.
- Carbon Icons everywhere (chrome + system theme).
- Strict 8px grid via `--cds-spacing-01` … `--cds-spacing-13` tokens; CI
  lint rejects raw `px` in `data/css/*.css`.
- Centralized design tokens in `data/css/tokens.css`.
- Full custom widget library locked in `mackes/carbon/`: Tile, DataTable,
  Accordion, NumberInput, MultiSelect, Notification, Toast, Modal,
  Skeleton, Button (5-tier), UIShell.

### Mesh fabric (§8.10–§8.14)
- **Mesh Thunar Extension** (Q-MX1–Q-MX20): `mesh:///` GVFS backend +
  Tumbler thumbnailer. Four subtrees — Peers (SSHFS, live), Clipboard
  (NATS-backed, 100-item ring + Saved/), Notifications (.md per entry),
  Object Store (Themes / Snapshots / Presets / Drop). Live updates via
  qnmd→FUSE inotify. 16-peer cap.
- **Mesh VPN** (§8.11): Headscale + Tailscale clients. Auto-elected
  control node with NATS-state replication + 30s snapshot. Tailscale-
  bootstrap (Option C) for cross-network discovery — only seed peer signs
  into Tailscale's free tier (1/100 node count forever).
- **Headless Node Mode** (§8.12, Q-HL1–Q-HL7): full `mackes init` /
  `mackes join` / `mackes status` / etc. CLI parity with the GUI panels.
  Auto-detect missing display + logind graphical session. New
  `data/presets/node.yaml` headless preset. `mackes-node.service` systemd
  unit.
- **Mesh Media Services** (§8.13, 5 layers): raw URLs / Media Hub panel /
  Caddy gateway / bundled native clients / mDNS-over-mesh relay. Shared
  catalog `data/media-services.yaml` consumed by all layers.
- **Mesh SSH** (§8.14, 3 layers): SSH cheatsheet + auto-distributed
  ed25519 keys via NATS + Tailscale-SSH identity-based access via
  Headscale. Audit log in NATS `mesh.ssh-audit`.

### Help / Documentation
- New comprehensive Help system: `docs/help/*.md` covers every feature.
  Surfaced via a Help tab in the workbench and `mackes help [topic]` in
  headless mode.

### Removals
- Deleted: `mackes/polybar_catalog.py`, `mackes/polybar_gen.py`,
  `mackes/shell_profiles.py`, `mackes/session_manager.py`,
  `mackes/workbench/shell/{polybar,plank,rofi,panel_visibility}.py`,
  `mackes/wizard/pages/shell.py`,
  `tests/test_{polybar_catalog,shell_profiles,shell_profiles_save}.py`.
- Deleted directories: `data/shell-profiles/` (8.7 MB of adi1090x families),
  `data/plank-themes/` (440 KB of dock themes).
- Net cleanup: ~1,200 file deletions; -631 / +191 lines across surviving
  source files.

### Packaging
- RPM hard `Requires`: xfce4-session, xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin,
  xfce4-docklike-plugin, xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin,
  xfce4-power-manager-plugin, openssh-server, headscale, tailscale.
- `Recommends`: caddy, jellyfin-media-player, strawberry,
  ibm-plex-sans-fonts, ibm-plex-mono-fonts, firewalld, pulseaudio-utils.
- Dropped: polybar, plank, rofi, dunst, picom, papirus-icon-theme,
  arc-theme, google-droid-sans-fonts, jetbrains-mono-fonts.

## Unreleased (post-0.1.1 redesign)

### Identity

- Stripped "PRIVATE WORK / Sub Testing Release" from dashboard, wizard,
  and About dialog. Mackes Shell is no longer marked as private testing
  in user-visible copy.
- Reimagined first-run wizard as a 3-act ceremony (Welcome → Pick a
  preset → Narrated apply). Welcome is spare (logo + 3 sentences + one
  details disclosure). Preset pick is a 4-card grid with wallpaper
  thumbnails. Apply has a dynamic title that transforms from "Becoming
  <preset>…" to "You are now <preset>."

### Presets

- Replaced single `chupre.yaml` with **four presets**:
  `hashbang` (display `#!`, default), `mackes`, `daylight`, `vanilla`.
- Each preset ships its own polybar, plank, and rofi profiles.
- Per-preset wallpapers in `data/wallpapers/`.
- `DEFAULT_PRESET_NAME = "hashbang"` — Mackes' first impression is the
  CrunchBang reincarnation.

### Design system

- SF Pro fonts installed and wired as the GUI default.
- `data/css/mackes.css` defines `.mackes-panel-title`,
  `.mackes-section-header`, `.mackes-info`, `.mackes-row-label`.
- `data/css/accents/<preset>.css` swaps `@define-color mackes_accent`
  per active preset.
- `app.py` loads base CSS + per-preset accent at startup, process-scoped.
- Monospace surfaces (log viewers, action streams) preserved with
  JetBrains Mono / Iosevka / Fira Code fallback.

### Polybar Editor (replaces preset-picker)

- New `mackes/polybar_catalog.py` — discovers 21 vendored adi1090x
  families across `simple/` and `bitmap/` variants.
- New `mackes/polybar_gen.py` — pure-function config generator with CLI
  (`python3 -m mackes.polybar_gen --theme <family>`).
- New editor panel: theme picker + geometry knobs + 3-zone DnD module
  editor with cross-zone drag + add-module popover + save-as-profile +
  copy-to-clipboard + live debounced apply (~300 ms).
- 8.7 MB upstream vendor (simple + bitmap, GPL-3.0, no fonts/wallpapers).

### MaintenanceKit

- **System Update** — pkexec dnf-upgrade wrapper with streaming log
- **Drift** — first-class drift surface with per-key revert/adopt/ignore
- **Fonts** — fc-list browser with Pango preview + dnf quick-install set
- **Power** — power-profiles-daemon selector + tlp summary fallback
- **Resources** — CPU / RAM / disk cards, 1.5 s live refresh, /proc-based

### Recovery shell

- New `mackes/recover.py` — TTY-driven snapshot picker
  (`python3 -m mackes.recover` / `--list` / `--latest`)
- `data/systemd/mackes-recovery.target` — multi-user + network target
- `data/grub/40_mackes_recovery` — GRUB submenu source
- `install-helpers/install-recovery.sh` — root-needed installer

### Update mechanism

- `data/dnf/mackes-shell.repo` — dnf repo manifest pointing at
  `https://matthewmackes.github.io/MAP2-RELEASES/fedora/$releasever/$basearch`
- `install-helpers/add-mackes-repo.sh` — drops the .repo into
  `/etc/yum.repos.d/`

### ISO build

- `packaging/iso/mackes-xfce.ks` — Fedora kickstart with mackes-shell
  baked in, polybar/plank/rofi/dunst/picom stack, dnf repo wiring,
  recovery shell wiring
- `make iso` target wrapping `livemedia-creator`

### Tests + dev tooling

- 20 passing tests including 9 new ones for polybar catalog/gen, plus
  CSS resolution, shell-profile save plumbing, recovery CLI
- `tests/_run_without_pytest.py` — runs the suite without pytest
  installed (handy fallback for fresh Fedora boxes)
- `make test-nodeps` target

### Headless apply

- `python3 -m mackes.cli_apply --preset NAME` — re-apply a preset
  without the GUI (SSH, automation, recovery flows)

### Documentation

- README rewritten to reflect actual feature surface (was a skeleton-
  status placeholder)
- `packaging/iso/README.md` — kickstart build docs
- `data/shell-profiles/polybar/upstream/ATTRIBUTION.md` — GPL-3.0
  attribution + refresh procedure

## 0.1.1

Initial single-binary skeleton with placeholder panels and the chupre
preset baseline. (Pre-redesign state captured in the original `docs/`
folder.)
