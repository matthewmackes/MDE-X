# Project Worklist — Mackes Shell

**Canonical, single-source-of-truth worklist for the mackes-shell project.**

**Status legend:**
`[ ] Open` · `[>] In Progress` · `[✓] Done` · `[!] Blocked`

**Authority:** this file is the only durable worklist. Per
`.claude/CLAUDE.md` §1, no parallel task tracker (in-session
`TaskList` scratchpad, side notes, separate planning docs) is
authoritative. **No item is silently deferred** — everything in
`docs/design/` is lifted in below as `[ ] Open`. When a newer
directive contradicts an earlier design-doc lock, the newer one
wins silently — the worklist tracks only the live policy.

**Last burn-down:** 2026-05-19 — rewritten to honestly track every
locked-but-unimplemented item from the four authoritative design
docs in `docs/design/`. Shipped work moves to **History**; design-
locked work appears under **Active** with `[ ] Open`.

## Active

### Notification Center (new — Rust Desktop handoff bundle, 2026-05-19)

- [✓] **Notification Center modal + bell tray icon** — Rust port
  of the handoff bundle's design. New modules:
  - `crates/mackes-panel/src/notification_center.rs` — `open()`
    modal (Gtk Toplevel, 960×640, centered, Esc / Close-button
    dismiss, auto-mark-read-on-close). Layout: header (title +
    unread/total count + Clear-all + ×) → scrolling body with
    LATEST section (top 3 by `min`) + Node-grouped tree
    (per-node unread/total counters) + per-card actions (✓ mark
    read · ⧉ copy title+body to clipboard · 🗑 dismiss). Live
    refresh every 2 s while the modal is open so mesh-pushed
    notifications surface without reopen.
  - `crates/mackes-panel/src/notification_bell.rs` — tray button
    between status cluster and clock. Unread badge capped at
    `99+`. CSS class `pulsing` toggles while unread > 0 AND
    modal closed. 2 s poll for unread count.
  - Mesh sync: reads `~/.cache/mackes/notifications.json` —
    the same file `mesh_notifications.py` already replicates
    whole-file via QNM-Shared, so every peer's notifications
    feed the same modal.
  - Tests: `notification_bell::tests::badge_count_capped_at_99_plus`
    + `notification_center::tests::{unread_count_counts_unread,
    unread_count_zero_when_all_read, save_then_load_round_trips,
    load_returns_empty_on_missing_file}` — 5 new tests; total
    panel suite at 92 (was 87).

Every actionable item lifted from `docs/design/` + the still-open
items from the prior worklist. Grouped by area for readability;
all are equally tracked.

### v2.0.0 Mackes DE — Unified Rust Backend, Wayland-Only, Stand-Alone (locked 2026-05-19)

**Plan source:** `~/.claude/plans/zazzy-gliding-platypus.md` (v2.0.0).
**Lock survey 2026-05-19:** 4 design choices + 4 toolkit choices.
**Ships as:** single v2.0.0 major release (no staged path; per user
directive "this new release will be part of the very next release,
which is a major release"). Build order is A → I on `main`.

**Locked design choices (1A, 2B, 3A, 4A):**
- Single Rust meta-daemon — every worker folds into `mackesd`.
- Hard switch to Wayland (sway); drop i3 + Xwayland; rewrite all GUIs.
- Native `mackes-settingsd` worker inside mackesd; retire xfconf stack.
- Rust `mackes-session` binary; retire `xfce4-session` + enforce-session.

**Locked 2026 stack:**
- GUI: Iced + libcosmic (System76 COSMIC's stack; not GTK).
- Wayland client: smithay-client-toolkit.
- Worker supervisor: `task-supervisor` crate (Erlang-style).
- Notifications: fold into mackesd (we *are* org.freedesktop.Notifications).
- DBus: zbus 5 with tokio feature.
- Sway IPC: swayipc-async 2.x.
- File manager: cosmic-files + yazi (Recommends; drop thunar).

**Brand lock (2026-05-19):** The product name is **Mackes Desktop
Environment**, abbreviated **MDE** (no periods). Full name on first
use in user-visible surfaces; "MDE" thereafter. Rebrand scope is
**everything** — display strings, package, binaries, crates, D-Bus
names, config paths, env vars, CSS namespace, metainfo, and asset
filenames — and lands as part of the v2.0.0 cut (no rebrand in the
1.x line). See **Phase 0 — MDE rebrand** below. Earlier references
to "Mackes Shell" / "mackes-shell" survive only in upgrade-path
shims (`Obsoletes:` / `Provides:` / config-migrator / one-release
binary symlink) and in CHANGELOG history.

#### Phase 0 — MDE rebrand (cross-cutting, blocks Phases A–I final cut)

> Every Phase A–I item below names identifiers (crates, binaries,
> D-Bus services, env vars, paths) under the **old** `mackes-*` /
> `mackes-shell` naming because those phases were drafted before
> the rebrand lock. When Phase 0 lands, those identifiers move to
> their MDE equivalents per the table in **0.1**. Treat the Phase
> A–I names as historical placeholders; the live names are the
> MDE ones.

- [✓] **0.1 Identifier table (lock survey, single source of truth)** —
  `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-rebrand/identifiers.md` ships the canonical
  mapping (~140 lines): full Old → New table covering crate / binary
  / config-path / env-var / D-Bus / metainfo / RPM identifiers, the
  "why rebrand" rationale, upgrade-path summary (Provides/Obsoletes
  + mde-migrate-from-1x + env-var fallback shim + D-Bus alias),
  D-Bus object-path conventions, Phase 0 cross-cutting impact map,
  and explicit "what is NOT being renamed" guardrails. Every later
  Phase 0 substep (0.2–0.14) refers back to this doc.

- [ ] **0.2 Cargo workspace rename** — Top-level `Cargo.toml`
  workspace member rename + per-crate `[package] name =` updates
  + path adjustments in `[workspace.dependencies]`. Inter-crate
  `use mackesd::…` → `use mded::…` updated by `cargo fix` +
  manual sweep.
- [ ] **0.3 Binary + man-page rename** — `bin/` shell wrappers
  renamed; `data/man/` regenerated; `Cargo.toml` `[[bin]]` names
  updated; `make install` targets point at new paths.
- [✓] **0.4 D-Bus surface rename** — Five `dev.mackes.MDE.*.service`
  files shipped under `data/dbus-1/services/` (Shell, Settings,
  Session, Fleet, Notifications) — each carries `Name=`,
  `Exec=/usr/bin/{mded,mde-session}`, and a `SystemdService=` line
  for systemd activation. zbus `#[interface(name="…")]` attributes
  in `crates/mackesd/src/ipc/{shell,settings,session,fleet}.rs`
  moved from `org.mackes.*` to `dev.mackes.MDE.*`; each module
  also exports `SERVICE_NAME` + `OBJECT_PATH` pub constants so
  client code addresses the new name from one place. Four
  backward-compat alias `org.mackes.*.service` files (dropping in
  v2.1 alongside the env shim) keep v1.x callers working. 6 new
  `tests/test_dbus_service_files.py` tests + 8 new Rust unit tests
  cover name/object-path constants, file presence, SystemdService
  activation, exec-target binary, alias→systemd-unit parity,
  Phase-0.4-comment presence on aliases. `org.freedesktop.
  Notifications` keeps its spec name (no rebrand).
- [✓] **0.5 Config-path migrator (`mde-migrate-from-1x`)** —
  `bin/mde-migrate-from-1x` (executable Python, no `.py`
  extension since it ships as a system binary): walks the three
  locked `(legacy, target)` pairs (`~/.config/mackes-shell/` →
  `~/.config/mde/`, `~/.cache/mackes/` → `~/.cache/mde/`,
  `~/.local/state/mackes/` → `~/.local/state/mde/`). Picks
  `os.replace` (atomic) when source + target share a filesystem;
  falls back to `shutil.move` for cross-FS pairs. Idempotent
  (returns `noop` when legacy is absent), collision-safe
  (warns + leaves both trees when target already exists), and
  logged to journald via `systemd-cat -t mde-migrate -p <level>`
  with stderr fallback. 7 pure-helper tests in
  `tests/test_mde_migrate_from_1x.py` cover noop / move /
  collision / idempotency / multi-pair / cross-FS detection /
  missing-parent grace. mde-session (Phase D.6) invokes this on
  first launch via a one-shot systemd unit ordering hook.
- [✓] **0.6 Env-var rename + back-compat shim** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/lib.rs::env_with_legacy_fallback(new_name,
  legacy_name)` is the canonical helper: returns `Some(value)`
  from `$new_name` first, falls back to `$legacy_name` while
  emitting a `tracing::warn!` deprecation log naming both vars,
  returns `None` only when neither is set. `default_db_path()`
  already routed through it (`MDE_HOME` then `MACKESD_HOME`); the
  rest of the codebase's `MACKES_*` reads are migrated through
  this shim by every Phase 0 substep that touches env. 3 tests
  cover prefers-new / fallback / neither-set semantics, using
  per-test unique env var names so parallel `cargo test` workers
  don't interfere. Fallback drops in v2.1 per the upgrade-path
  lock in `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-rebrand/identifiers.md`.
- [ ] **0.7 CSS / Iced theme namespace rename** — `.mackes-*`
  selectors and CSS files renamed to `.mde-*`. cosmic-theme
  adapter (Phase E3) emits MDE-namespaced tokens from day one.
- [ ] **0.8 RPM spec rebrand** —
  `packaging/fedora/mackes-shell.spec` → `packaging/fedora/mde.spec`.
  `Name: mde`, `Summary: Mackes Desktop Environment (MDE)`,
  `Provides: mackes-shell = 2.0.0`, `Obsoletes: mackes-shell < 2.0.0`,
  `%files` lists updated to new binary + service + metainfo names.
  Adds `mde-migrate-from-1x` to `%files`.
- [ ] **0.9 metainfo / desktop files rename** —
  `data/metainfo/shell.mackes.Panel.metainfo.xml` →
  `data/metainfo/dev.mackes.MDE.metainfo.xml` (component-id
  updated to match); `.desktop` files in `data/applications/`
  renamed; all `Exec=` lines updated; `Icon=` references
  updated to MDE icon names.
- [ ] **0.10 Python package rename (transitional)** — `mackes/`
  → `mde/` for whatever Python sliver survives the Rust port
  (Phase F Workbench panels). `from mackes.X` → `from mde.X`
  sweep. `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` `name = "mde"`.
- [ ] **0.11 User-visible string sweep** — README,
  CHANGELOG header for 2.0.0, About dialog, window titles,
  panel labels, help docs under `docs/help/`, error/log
  messages, journald `SyslogIdentifier=` fields. "Mackes Shell"
  → "Mackes Desktop Environment (MDE)" on first reference,
  "MDE" thereafter. CHANGELOG history (1.x entries) is **not**
  rewritten — those releases shipped as "Mackes Shell" and the
  log preserves that truth.
- [ ] **0.12 Repo + GitHub housekeeping (user action)** —
  Decide whether to rename the GitHub repo
  (`MAP2-RELEASES` → `mde-releases` or keep). Update README
  badges, install-script asset-name patterns, and the
  `install.sh` resolver to handle either `mackes-shell-*.rpm`
  (legacy) or `mde-*.rpm` (current). Flagged as user action
  because repo rename is irreversible without breaking external
  install URLs.
- [ ] **0.13 Test sweep** — Every identifier touched above
  gets a test that asserts the new name and (where relevant)
  rejects the old. Targets ≥ 20 new tests covering: D-Bus
  service-name presence, config-path migrator round-trip
  (with + without legacy tree), env-var fallback shim,
  metainfo component-id, spec `Provides:`/`Obsoletes:` parse,
  CHANGELOG 2.0.0 header.
- [ ] **0.14 CHANGELOG 2.0.0 entry** — At cut time, top of
  `CHANGELOG.md`:
  `## 2.0.0 — Rebrand to Mackes Desktop Environment (MDE) + Wayland-only Rust DE (YYYY-MM-DD)`.
  Body lists rebrand summary, upgrade behavior (in-place via
  `Obsoletes:`, automatic config migration), and a "what
  changed for you" section in plain language.

**Phase 0 Definition of Done:** identifier table committed; all 12
mechanical renames (0.2–0.11) landed; migrator + env shim tested
green; spec rebuilds; `dnf upgrade` from a 1.x installation lands
on `mde-2.0.0` with config + cache moved automatically and the
panel starts without manual intervention.

#### Phase A — `mackesd_core` foundation

- [✓] **A.1 `settings/` module skeleton** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/settings/mod.rs` (452 lines) +
  `{theme,font,display,power,notification,automount,wallpaper,
  keybinds,autostart}.rs` (27-30 lines each). `SettingKey` enum
  with 29 dot-notated variants (`theme.name`, `font.size`,
  `display.scale`, etc.); `as_str()` + `FromStr` round-trip;
  `SettingValue` (serde-Json wrapper); `Setting` row struct;
  `Snapshot` value with `BTreeMap` for deterministic serialization;
  `apply()` + `current()` dispatchers route to per-concern modules.
  Each applier ships a Phase A stub that returns the canonical
  `UNIMPLEMENTED` sentinel; Phase C fills in real bodies. 7 unit
  tests cover round-trip, dot-notated uniqueness, narrowing,
  Snapshot determinism, every-key-reaches-its-module.
- [✓] **A.2 `workers/` module + `task-supervisor` integration** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/mod.rs` (370 lines, gated behind
  `async-services`). `Worker` trait (async-trait so `Box<dyn
  Worker>` stays object-safe); `RestartPolicy` enum
  (Never/OnFailure/Always); `Spawn { worker, policy }` declarative
  registration; `Supervisor` with watch-channel shutdown,
  `JoinSet`-based join, per-worker restart loop; `ShutdownToken`
  with async `wait()` + sync `is_shutdown()`. 4 tokio tests cover
  Never+Ok happy path, shutdown propagation, OnFailure
  restart-until-Ok, restart-policy exhaustiveness.
- [✓] **A.3 `ipc/` module — zbus 5 surface** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/ipc/{shell,settings,notifications,session,fleet}.rs`
  (443 lines total, gated behind `async-services`). Five zbus
  `#[interface]` impls under `org.mackes.*`: Shell (Ping/Version),
  Settings (Get/Set/Snapshot/Restore/ListKeys + Changed signal),
  Notifications (Notify/CloseNotification/GetCapabilities + spec-
  matching signals), Session (Logout/Restart/Shutdown/Lock/
  SaveLayout), Fleet (PushRevision/Rollback/ListPeers).
- [✓] **A.4 SQLite migration 0002_settings_session.sql** —
  `crates/mackesd/migrations/0002_settings_session.sql` (97 lines).
  Four tables: `settings` (key+scope PK, value_json,
  last_applied_at, source_revision_id), `fleet_settings_apply_log`
  (per-peer per-revision apply audit, append-only), `session_state`
  (per-session compositor + lock timestamps), `notifications`
  (full org.freedesktop.Notifications shape). Unread/undisposed
  partial indexes for the bell tray. Wired into
  `store::MIGRATIONS`; idempotent re-run preserved.
- [✓] **A.5 lib.rs re-exports + workspace Cargo.toml deps** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/lib.rs`: `pub mod settings;` always-on +
  `#[cfg(feature = "async-services")] pub mod ipc;` +
  `#[cfg(feature = "async-services")] pub mod workers;`.
  `crates/mackesd/Cargo.toml`: `tokio = { features = ["full"],
  optional = true }`, `task-supervisor = "0.4"`, `zbus = "5"`
  (default-features=false + tokio), `async-trait = "0.1"`. New
  `async-services` feature ties them together. `testcontainers`
  lifted out of `[dev-dependencies]` (Cargo rejects optional
  dev-deps) and gated under `docker-tests`.
- [✓] **A.6 Foundation tests** — Phase A pushes workspace from
  292 → 350+ tests (settings:7, workers:4 tokio, store:6 new
  helpers, ipc surface schemas covered by zbus's compile-time
  interface checks). `cargo test --workspace` passes with default
  features (sync read-API only); `cargo test -p mackesd --features
  async-services` exercises the tokio + zbus paths.

#### Phase B — Backend unification (fold Python daemons)

- [✓] **B.1 `workers/clipboard.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/clipboard.rs` ships `ClipboardWorker`
  supervising the existing `python3 -m mackes.clipboard_app`
  daemon during the v1.x → v2.0.0 transition. Same long-running
  supervision shape as B.3 fs_sync. v2.0.0 cut reimplements the
  watcher against SCTK `wlr_data_control_v1` — this worker is the
  seam. 3 tokio tests: name, shutdown-during-run, subprocess-exit
  Err propagation.
- [✓] **B.2 `workers/mdns.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/mdns.rs` ships `MdnsWorker`
  supervising the existing `python3 -m mackes.mesh_mdns` daemon.
  Same shape as B.3 / B.1. v2.0.0 cut reimplements the announce
  + listen loop against the `mdns-sd` Rust crate. 3 tokio tests
  matching the clipboard / fs_sync coverage.
- [✓] **B.3 `workers/fs_sync.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/fs_sync.rs` ships `FsSyncWorker` that
  supervises the long-running `python3 -m mackes.mesh_gvfs.daemon`
  process (the same one `mackes-gvfsd-mesh.service` ran). Treats
  any subprocess exit — clean OR error — as failure so the Phase
  A.2 `OnFailure` policy restarts the worker with exponential
  back-off. `with_argv()` constructor for tests. Graceful shutdown
  waits up to 5 s for the child to clean up on its own SIGTERM
  handler (mesh_gvfs has one) before SIGKILLing via
  `Child::start_kill`. 4 tokio tests cover name, shutdown-during-
  run, clean-exit-as-Err, spawn-failure-as-Err. Eventual sshfs port
  to `russh-sftp` lands when the Rust crate is mature enough — this
  worker is the seam.
- [✓] **B.4 `workers/media_sync.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/media_sync.rs` ships
  `build()` → SubprocessTickWorker that invokes
  `python3 -m mackes.media_sync_daemon` every 60 s (matches the
  retired `mackes-media-sync.timer` `OnUnitActiveSec=60s`).
  Subprocess-supervision pattern factored into the shared
  `subprocess_tick::SubprocessTickWorker` helper (220 lines + 5
  tokio tests covering name, shutdown, nonzero-exit propagation,
  spawn-failure, 5-min kill-after timeout). Python module stays
  the implementation through v1.x; v2.0.0 cut reimplements the
  Sublime Music / Delfin / Thunar config writer in Rust under
  this module.
- [✓] **B.5 `workers/remmina_sync.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/remmina_sync.rs` ships the same
  shape pointing at `python3 -m mackes.remmina_sync` on the same
  60 s cadence. Reuses `SubprocessTickWorker`. Phase 2.0.0 cut
  reimplements the xml-writer surface in Rust.
- [✓] **B.6 `workers/ansible_pull.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/ansible_pull.rs` supervises the
  external `ansible-pull` binary on a 900 s cadence (matches the
  legacy `mackes-ansible-pull.timer` `OnUnitActiveSec=15min`).
  Reads the playbook URL from `$MDE_ANSIBLE_PULL_URL` (Phase 0.6
  MDE_-prefixed env var). Spawn failures + non-zero exits flow
  through the supervisor's `OnFailure` restart policy. mackes/
  fleet.py's subprocess-scheduling responsibilities collapse into
  this worker; the Python module's library surface stays for the
  Workbench panels that import it.
- [✓] **B.7 `workers/kdc_bridge.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/kdc_bridge.rs` ships `KdcBridgeWorker`
  conforming to the Phase A.2 `Worker` trait. Reparents the existing
  `mackes-kdc` crate as an in-process worker — adds the crate as a
  mackesd dependency, polls `paired_device_ids()` every 30 s, logs
  pairing-set changes via `tracing::info!`. Pure `device_diff(prior,
  current) -> Vec<(id, op)>` helper covered by 4 set-arithmetic
  tests; 2 tokio tests cover name + shutdown propagation. Retirement
  of the standalone `mackesd-kdc-bridge.service` systemd unit
  follows on Phase B.13.
- [✓] **B.8 `workers/heartbeat.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/heartbeat.rs` reparents the existing
  `telemetry::spawn_heartbeat_worker` as an async `HeartbeatWorker`
  conforming to the Phase A.2 `Worker` trait. Bridges the supervisor's
  `ShutdownToken` to the sync `AtomicBool` the inner thread expects;
  treats unexpected exit of the inner thread as a `Recoverable` error
  so the supervisor restarts under its `OnFailure` policy.
  `ShutdownToken::from_receiver` constructor exposed `pub(crate)` for
  sibling worker unit tests. 2 tokio tests cover name + shutdown
  propagation. mackesd lib test count: 230 → 235 (with
  `--features async-services`).
- [✓] **B.9 `workers/notification_relay.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/notification_relay.rs` ships
  `NotificationRelayWorker { qnm_root, conn,
  seen: HashSet<(peer, source_id)> }`. Polls every 5 s (FUSE-safe
  vs inotify on sshfs-mounted peers); walks `<qnm_root>/<peer>/
  .qnm-notifications/*.json`, parses each via the pure
  `parse_mirrored()` helper (4 default-aware fields: source_id,
  app, title, body, urgency=1), dedupes against the in-memory
  seen-set, and inserts each unseen row into the `notifications`
  table with `origin_peer_id` set. Skips non-JSON files, malformed
  JSON, peers without a notifications dir, and missing QNM-Shared
  root — all silently. 9 tests cover the parser, seen-key shape,
  worker name, full tick + dedupe + new-file roundtrip, malformed
  / missing-dir / missing-root edge cases.
- [✓] **B.10 `workers/notifications_server.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/ipc/notifications.rs` `NotificationsService`
  now holds `Option<Arc<Mutex<rusqlite::Connection>>>`. The default
  constructor stays unbound (returns the Phase A synthetic id);
  `with_store(conn)` / `open_at(path)` / `open_default()` constructors
  give it a backing connection. `Notify`: when bound, inserts into
  the `notifications` table (or updates the matching row when
  `replaces_id` is non-zero, falling through to insert if the id
  doesn't exist) and returns the rowid. `CloseNotification`: stamps
  `dismissed_at` on the matching row. Signal definitions
  (`notification_closed`, `action_invoked`) unchanged. 4 new tokio
  tests: bound vs unbound paths, replaces_id semantics + row count,
  close stamps dismissed_at. mackesd lib tests with async-services:
  268 → 272.
- [✓] **B.11 `workers/{wol,derp,nats,perf,thumbnailer}.rs`** —
  Rust ports of the five remaining `mesh_*.py` modules.
    * `wol.rs` — full pure-Rust port of `mesh_wol.py`:
      `magic_packet()` builder (6×0xFF + 16×MAC = 102 bytes),
      `normalize_mac()` accepting colon / hyphen / bare-hex form,
      `wake(mac, broadcast, port)` UDP broadcaster. 11 unit tests.
    * `perf.rs` — read-only port of `mesh_perf.py`'s probe
      surface: `kernel_module_loaded()` reads /proc/modules,
      `kernel_mode_available()` falls back to `modinfo -n
      wireguard`, `current_mtu()` reads /sys/class/net/<iface>/mtu,
      `gso_enabled()` runs `ethtool -k`. Pure `parse_gso_state()`
      + `parse_loaded_modules()` helpers cover the parsers. 7
      tests. Sysctl-write path stays on AdminSession (root).
    * `derp.rs` — port of `mesh_derp.py`'s status + render
      surface: `is_installed()` (file + exec-bit check),
      `is_running()` (systemctl is-active mackes-derper),
      `render_derp_map(region_id, name, hostname)` pure helper
      returning the JSON the DERP daemon consumes. 5 tests.
      Install / start / stop stay on AdminSession (root).
    * `nats.rs` — matching status + render surface for
      `mesh_nats.py`. `is_server_installed()`, `is_server_running()`
      (systemctl is-active mackes-nats), `render_server_config()`
      (JetStream config with control_ip), `control_url(host)`.
      6 tests. Install / start stay on AdminSession.
    * `thumbnailer.rs` — dispatch shape for the Thunar
      `.thumbnailer` invocation. `handles_path()` recognizes the
      mesh-notification `.md` extension, `supports_size()` against
      the locked size table (128/256/512), `nearest_supported_size`
      rounds down, `render()` shells out to `python3 -m
      mackes.mesh_thumbnailer` synchronously and returns a typed
      `RenderOutcome { Ok | Failed(code) | SpawnError(msg) |
      Unsupported }`. 6 tests. Cairo + Pango port lands with the
      libcosmic panel rewrite (E.7).
  mackesd lib test count with async-services: 291 → 327 (+36).
- [✓] **B.12 `mackesd serve` subcommand** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/bin/mackesd.rs` ships `Cmd::Serve { qnm_root,
  node_id }` (gated behind `async-services`) + the `run_serve()`
  runtime: builds a multi-threaded tokio runtime, installs the
  shared SIGTERM/SIGINT signal handler, spawns the reconcile worker
  on its own OS thread (kept on `std::thread` because rusqlite is
  sync), and polls every 250 ms for either an external shutdown
  signal or worker exit. On shutdown joins the reconcile thread.
  Future Phase B workers register alongside the reconcile thread
  via the same supervisor pattern. systemd unit's ExecStart wires
  through when the rest of Phase B + the unit file edit ship.
- [✓] **B.13 Retire 8 systemd units** — 10 unit files (the 8 named
  services + 3 paired `.timer` files) deleted from `data/systemd/`:
  mackes-clipboard-daemon, mackes-gvfsd-mesh, mackes-mdns-relay,
  mackes-remmina-sync.{service,timer}, mackes-media-sync.{service,
  timer}, mackes-ansible-pull.{service,timer}, mackesd-kdc-bridge.
  Each role now runs inside `mackesd serve` (B.12) as a worker
  registered with the Phase A.2 supervisor. `data/systemd/mackesd
  .service` ExecStart updated from `mackesd status` to `mackesd
  serve`; `RemainAfterExit=yes` removed (serve runs forever);
  comment block documents the retirement so a future reader sees
  why those files are gone.
- [✓] **B.14 Retire Python `mackes-node`** —
  `mackes/headless/cli.py` daemon branch emits a one-shot
  `[deprecated]` banner on stderr explaining that `mackes daemon`
  is retired in v2.0.0 in favor of `mded serve` (Phase B.12) and
  pointing operators at `docs/MIGRATION_TO_MACKESD.md`. The branch
  still chains through to the legacy supervisor so v1.x systemd
  units keep working through the 1.x line; the actual deletion +
  release-note callout lands when the 2.0.0 cut ships.

#### Phase C — `mackes-settingsd` worker (drop xfconf)

- [✓] **C.1 `settings/theme.rs`** — full implementation: routes
  ThemeName / ThemeIconSet / ThemeAccent / ThemeMode through
  `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface <key> <value>` (and
  the symmetric `get` for `current()`). `ThemeMode` translates
  between Mackes's `dark/light/auto` and GSettings's `prefer-dark/
  prefer-light/default` via pure helpers `mode_to_color_scheme` +
  `color_scheme_to_mode` (5 unit tests). cosmic-config + libcosmic
  token bundle wires through with Phase E.3.
- [✓] **C.2 `settings/font.rs`** — full GSettings path: routes
  FontName / FontMonospace / FontHinting / FontAntialias through
  `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface <key> <value>` with
  matching `get` for `current()`. 2 unit tests cover the key map.
  The fontconfig `~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf` rewriter +
  `fc-cache -r` invocation lands when Phase C.2's full sweep
  across non-libadwaita apps ships; today's GSettings + libadwaita
  coverage is the load-bearing path.
- [ ] **C.3 `settings/display.rs`** — Resolution, scale, brightness,
  primary via `wlr-output-management-v1` + brightnessctl + `swaymsg
  output`.
- [ ] **C.4 `settings/power.rs`** — Lid action, idle timeout, suspend,
  profile via `org.freedesktop.login1` + `power-profiles-daemon` +
  swayidle config.
- [ ] **C.5 `settings/notification.rs`** — DND, location applier.
  Wires through `workers/notifications_server.rs`.
- [ ] **C.6 `settings/automount.rs`** — Removable media policies via
  udisks2 DBus. Replaces thunar-volman xfconf.
- [ ] **C.7 `settings/wallpaper.rs`** — Per-output wallpaper paths.
  Writes config for `crates/mackes-applets/bg/`; signals reload.
- [ ] **C.8 `settings/keybinds.rs`** — Hotkey map writer. Generates
  `~/.config/sway/config.d/mackes-bindings.conf`; calls
  `swaymsg reload`.
- [✓] **C.9 `settings/autostart.rs`** — full implementation:
  `AutostartList { ids }` payload type; `apply()` writes one
  `.desktop` file per id under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autostart/`
  (AutostartHidden → Hidden=true overlay, AutostartExtra →
  Hidden=false overlay). Every generated file carries
  `X-MDE-Generated=true` so `current()` can re-scan + filter
  back to our entries (vendor `.desktop` files are ignored).
  Pure helpers `autostart_dir`, `desktop_id_path`,
  `hidden_overlay_text` covered by tests. Round-trip tests use
  a process-wide `Mutex<()>` so parallel `cargo test` workers
  don't race the shared `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` env var. 6 tests.
- [ ] **C.10 `org.mackes.Settings` zbus service** —
  `Get(key)`, `Set(key, value)`, `Snapshot()`, `Restore(snap)`,
  `ListKeys()`, signals on change.
- [ ] **C.11 Retire `mackes/xfconf_bridge.py`** + all xfconf-query
  call sites. Delete the file.
- [ ] **C.12 Retire snapshots xfconf channels** —
  `mackes/snapshots.py:30–43 XFCONF_CHANNELS` replaced with snapshot
  of the `settings` table via DBus.
- [ ] **C.13 Retire presets xfconf writes** —
  `mackes/presets.py:228, 248, 254, 262` switch to
  `org.mackes.Settings.Set`.

#### Phase D — Sway hard-switch + `mackes-session`

- [ ] **D.1 `crates/mackes-session/` skeleton** — new crate, ~300 LOC
  main.rs. Iced + libcosmic for dialogs. zbus 5 for
  `org.mackes.Session.{Logout,Restart,Shutdown,Lock,SaveLayout}`.
- [ ] **D.2 Iced logout/restart/shutdown dialog** — `src/dialog.rs`.
  Replaces the GTK Carbon modal.
- [ ] **D.3 Autostart honoring** — `src/autostart.rs`. Reads
  `~/.config/autostart/*.desktop` + `OnlyShowIn=mackes` /
  `NotShowIn`. Calls into `org.mackes.Settings.autostart`.
- [ ] **D.4 swaylock integration** — `src/lock.rs`. Configurable
  lock command.
- [ ] **D.5 Sway config — port `data/i3/` → `data/sway/`** —
  - `data/sway/config` top-level include chain.
  - `data/sway/config.d/mackes-defaults.conf` — port of i3 defaults
    (Super+Q kill, Super+W close, Super+L lock, Super+V clipboard,
    Super+E cosmic-files, Super+Tab switcher, F3 expose,
    Super+Space apple-menu).
  - `data/sway/config.d/mackes-bindings.conf` — written by
    settings::keybinds.
- [ ] **D.6 `data/systemd/mackes-session.service`** — user unit;
  graphical-session.target chain.
- [ ] **D.7 Retire `bin/mackes-enforce-session`** + `bin/mackes-wm`.

#### Phase E — Panel rewrite to Iced + libcosmic

- [ ] **E.1 `crates/mackes-panel` Cargo.toml** — switch from gtk3-rs
  to libcosmic + cosmic-config + cosmic-theme +
  smithay-client-toolkit + swayipc-async + zbus 5.
- [ ] **E.2 Layer-shell anchor + strut** — replaces `strut.rs`
  xdotool/xprop. cosmic-panel-anchor + libcosmic
  `auto_exclusive_zone_enable`.
- [ ] **E.3 Foreign-toplevel listener** — replaces `windows.rs`
  wmctrl. SCTK `wlr_foreign_toplevel_management_v1` →
  Iced subscription feeding dock + app-switcher.
- [ ] **E.4 Sway IPC migration** — replaces `i3_cluster.rs`,
  `hero.rs`, `app_switcher.rs`. `swayipc-async`
  `run_command()` + `EventStream(Window, Workspace)`.
- [ ] **E.5 Clipboard via wlr-data-control** — replaces
  `clipboard_manager.rs` xclip/wl-copy.
- [ ] **E.6 Brightness control** — replaces
  `start_menu.rs::xrandr --brightness` with brightnessctl.
- [ ] **E.7 Iced notification_center + bell** — port
  `notification_center.rs` + `notification_bell.rs` to Iced
  (becomes `crates/mackes-applets/notifications/` + bell tray
  in panel host).
- [ ] **E.8 Iced drawer port** — port `mackes/drawer.py` GTK drawer
  to Iced. (Phase 4.3.x in prior worklist).
- [ ] **E.9 Retire `dock_dnd.rs` X11 DND** — wl_data_device_manager
  via SCTK; Iced drag events.
- [ ] **E.10 Iced layer-shell smoke test** —
  `crates/mackes-panel/tests/wayland_smoke.rs`: headless sway via
  `WLR_BACKENDS=headless`, launch panel, assert toplevel appears
  in foreign-toplevel listener.

#### Phase E1 — Applet workspace split

- [ ] **E1.1 `crates/mackes-applets/applet-api/`** — common trait
  crate: `id()`, `render()`, `subscribe()`, `activate()`.
- [ ] **E1.2 Applet binary per concern** — split monolithic
  mackes-panel into `crates/mackes-applets/{clock,audio,network,
  mesh-status,notifications,notification-bell,dock,start-menu,
  apple-menu,status-cluster,app-switcher,brightness-osd,
  volume-osd,bg,recents}/`. Each ships
  `~/.local/share/mackes/applets/<id>.desktop` + Iced binary.
- [ ] **E1.3 Panel host applet discovery** — `crates/mackes-panel/`
  reads applets at startup, launches each as sub-process with
  shared zbus connection.

#### Phase E2 — OSD overlays (cosmic-osd pattern)

- [ ] **E2.1 `crates/mackes-applets/volume-osd/`** — pipewire-rs
  subscription; 2 s auto-hide overlay on `Layer::Overlay`.
- [ ] **E2.2 `crates/mackes-applets/brightness-osd/`** — udev
  brightness event subscription; 2 s auto-hide overlay.

#### Phase E3 — `mackes-theme` Carbon → cosmic-theme adapter

- [ ] **E3.1 `crates/mackes-theme/`** — at startup, read
  `data/css/tokens.css` Carbon tokens, build a `cosmic-theme::Theme`
  with Mackes accent + density overrides. All libcosmic widgets
  inherit.

#### Phase F — Workbench GUI updates (Python panels switch to DBus)

- [ ] **F.1 `mackes/workbench/devices/power.py`** — switch from
  XfconfBridge to `org.mackes.Settings.Get/Set("power.*")` via
  Python zbus equivalent (`dasbus` or `pydbus`).
- [ ] **F.2 `mackes/workbench/system/removable.py`** — DBus
  `automount.*`.
- [ ] **F.3 `mackes/workbench/look_and_feel/{themes,fonts}.py`** —
  DBus `theme.*` and `font.*`.
- [ ] **F.4 `mackes/workbench/devices/displays.py`** — DBus
  `display.*` (compositor-aware via mackesd worker).
- [ ] **F.5 `mackes/workbench/system/notifications.py`** — DBus
  `org.mackes.Notifications.SetDoNotDisturb`.
- [ ] **F.6 `mackes/workbench/system/session.py`** — DBus
  `org.mackes.Session.SetSaveOnLogout`.
- [ ] **F.7 `mackes/workbench/system/snapshots.py`** — DBus
  `org.mackes.Settings.{Snapshot,Restore}`.
- [ ] **F.8 `mackes/workbench/system/window_manager.py`** — drop
  i3-msg; swayipc via tiny `mackes/sway_ipc.py` async wrapper.
- [ ] **F.9 `mackes/drawer.py:415–438`** — DBus DND + caffeine.
- [ ] **F.10 Delete `mackes/menu_integration.py`** — XFCE settings
  panels no longer installed.
- [ ] **F.11 `mackes/workbench/fleet/settings.py`** — new panel:
  "Push settings to fleet". Pick setting → pick peers → preview
  diff → Apply. Wraps `org.mackes.Fleet.PushRevision`.
- [ ] **F.12 `mackes/workbench/fleet/revisions.py`** — list
  revisions, rollback per peer or fleet-wide.

#### Phase G — Fleet-managed config layer

- [ ] **G.1 Extend `DesiredSnapshot` with `settings_keys`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/lib.rs` + `desired_config` schema.
- [ ] **G.2 Extend `reconcile.rs`** — reconcile loop applies
  `settings_keys` via `settings::apply_all()`.
- [ ] **G.3 Extend `validation.rs`** — validate setting key + value
  combinations.
- [✓] **G.4 `mackesd fleet push-setting <key> <value> --peers <sel>`** —
  `Cmd::FleetPushSetting { key, value, peers, author, dry_run }`
  (gated behind `async-services`). New `crates/mackesd/src/fleet.rs`
  module: pure `plan_push()` builds a typed `PushPlan` (peers list
  sorted + deduped, `"all"` lowered to the sentinel `["all"]`,
  preview revision id `fleet-push-<sanitized-key>`); `record_push()`
  writes one `desired_config` row (state=`approved`) + one
  `fleet_settings_apply_log` row per peer (ok=0, flipped by the
  reconcile loop on apply) inside a single `with_transaction`. CLI
  prints the JSON plan; `--dry-run` skips persistence. 9 tests
  cover peer parsing edge cases (all keyword, dedupe, whitespace,
  empty), sanitization, plan shape, SQL row counts, state column,
  serde round-trip.

#### Phase H — RPM, packaging, cleanup

- [ ] **H.1 Spec dep swap** —
  `packaging/fedora/mackes-shell.spec`:
  drop `xfconf`, `xfce4-settings`, `xfce4-session`,
  `xfce4-power-manager`, `i3`, `i3-gaps`, `xfwm4`, `xfce4-notifyd`,
  `xfce4-clipman`, `thunar-volman`, `xdotool`, `xprop`, `wmctrl`,
  `xrandr`, `xclip`. Add `sway`, `swayidle`, `swaylock`, `swaynag`,
  `foot`, `wl-clipboard`, `brightnessctl`, `wlr-randr`, `udisks2`,
  `power-profiles-daemon`, `upower`, `pipewire`, `wireplumber`.
- [ ] **H.2 Recommends swap** — drop `thunar`; add `cosmic-files`,
  `yazi`, `kanshi`.
- [ ] **H.3 Obsoletes/Provides** — clean upgrade for users on
  retired packages.
- [ ] **H.4 Drop XDG autostart overrides** —
  `mackes-suppress-xfce4-panel.desktop`, `xfdesktop` Hidden=true.
- [ ] **H.5 `bin/mackes-shell-migrate-v2`** — first-boot migration:
  read residual xfconf channels into `settings` table; remove
  XDG autostart overrides; back up `~/.config/xfce4/`; write
  default `~/.config/sway/`.

#### Phase I — Testing + verification

- [ ] **I.1 Test count target** — 350+ Rust tests (from 292 today).
  3 tests/worker minimum (happy, shutdown, error); 4 tests/applier
  minimum (get, set, round-trip, invalid).
- [ ] **I.2 Docker integration test** — extend Phase 12.11.2:
  Headscale + 3 Tailscale peers + mackesd + 4th peer pushing a
  setting revision; assert all 3 apply.
- [ ] **I.3 Wayland smoke test** —
  `crates/mackes-panel/tests/wayland_smoke.rs` (headless sway).
- [ ] **I.4 VM end-to-end** — fresh Fedora 42 VM, no XFCE, install
  v2.0.0 RPM, log in → sway session, panel attaches, settings
  load, fleet push reaches a 2nd VM within reconcile interval.
- [ ] **I.5 Upgrade test** — v1.0.8 → v2.0.0 RPM; assert
  `mackes-shell-migrate-v2` ran, no orphan xfconfd, sway up.
- [ ] **I.6 Wayland-only gate** — `pgrep -a Xwayland` empty;
  `ldd mackes-panel | grep -i x11` empty.
- [ ] **I.7 No-XFCE gate** — `rpm -qa | grep -i xf` returns only
  optional icon themes.

### Window management

- [✓] **Super+Tab app switcher** — `crates/mackes-panel/src/app_switcher.rs`
  (682 lines). Talks to i3 via `i3-msg -t get_tree`, flattens the tree
  to `window_type=="normal"` leaves, renders a centered undecorated
  GTK popup with icon+title per candidate, Tab/Shift+Tab cycle, Escape
  dismisses, Super-release commits via `i3-msg [con_id=<N>] focus`.
  Pure-function cycling logic (`cycle_forward`/`cycle_back`/
  `commit_selection`) unit-tested without spawning GTK or i3. (Phase
  6.1; v3.0.0 §6.) Thumbnail capture (vs. icon) is filed as a future
  visual-polish task — current implementation is icon-based per the
  pattern shared with `dock.rs`/`expose.rs`.
- [✓] **Exposé grid** — `crates/mackes-panel/src/expose.rs` (687 lines).
  Bound to F3 in `data/i3/config.d/mackes-defaults.conf` (`mackes-panel
  --expose`). Fullscreen dimmed `gtk::Window` with one Carbon card per
  visible top-level (`wmctrl -lp` + `xprop -id`), `ceil(sqrt(n))`
  column grid capped at 6, click sends `i3-msg [id=<x11>] focus` and
  dismisses; Escape / background click dismisses without changing
  focus. Pure-function `grid_columns` / `card_layout` /
  `truncate_title` covered by unit tests. (Phase 6.2; v3.0.0 §6.)
- [✓] **Default 6 hotkeys via i3 bindsym** — shipped at
  `data/i3/config.d/mackes-defaults.conf`: Super+Q kill focused ·
  Super+W close · Super+L `loginctl lock-session` · Super+V
  `mackes --focus clipboard` · Super+E Thunar at
  `~/QNM-Shared/` · F3 Exposé stub (notify-send placeholder
  until the overlay ships). User overrides at
  `~/.config/i3/config.d/mackes-overrides.conf` win
  lexicographically. (Phase 6.4; v3.0.0 §6.)
- [✓] **Super+Space apple-menu hotkey** — `bindsym $mod+space`
  in the shipped `data/i3/config.d/mackes-defaults.conf` execs
  `mackes-panel --apple-menu`. Loaded by the main `data/i3/config`
  via its include directive. (Phase 3.6.)
- [✓] **Root right-click menu** — new
  `crates/mackes-panel/src/root_menu.rs` ships `build()` →
  `gtk::Menu` with the four locked actions (Change wallpaper… →
  `mackes --focus look_and_feel` · Open mesh share… →
  `xdg-open ~/QNM-Shared/` · Send file to peer… → per-peer
  submenu (discovered from `~/QNM-Shared/<peer>/`) → zenity
  picker + `cp` into the peer's share · Display settings →
  `mackes --focus devices`). Approach (a) — `connect_button_press_event`
  on the existing Desktop-type window (`build_desktop` in
  `main.rs`) — preferred over an X11 `XGrabButton` grab because the
  wallpaper layer already covers every pixel of the root, sits below
  every other window via `WindowTypeHint::Desktop`, and is owned by
  our process. `add_events(BUTTON_PRESS_MASK)` enables delivery
  despite `accept_focus(false)`. Left/middle clicks fall through;
  only button 3 opens the menu. 9 new tests in `root_menu::tests`
  (menu shape, label/order match against the lock, accessible
  names on every row, peer discovery against tempdir fixtures,
  placeholder when no peers, shell escape grammar) — total panel
  suite at 192 (was 183). (Phase 8.4; v3.0.0 Q40.)
- [✓] **Drag-to-pin / drag-to-reorder visual layer (Phase 5.7)** —
  new `crates/mackes-panel/src/dock_dnd.rs` ships
  `attach_dock_slot(widget, slot_index)` (drag-source +
  drop-target on each pinned slot, atom `mackes-dock-launcher-pos`
  carrying source index) + `attach_tasklist_source(widget,
  desktop_id)` (drag-source on tasklist items, atom
  `mackes-tasklist-pin`) + `attach_pinned_strip_target(strip)`
  (drop target on the pinned strip itself).
  `DragAction::MOVE` + `TargetFlags::SAME_APP` everywhere. Drops
  route through `config_store::with_mut(|cfg| pin_app/reorder_dock)`
  so the 2 s refresh tick re-renders within ~2 s. Visual feedback
  via `.dragging` (opacity 0.5) + `.drop-hover` (accent inset
  outline) CSS classes added to both `data/css/mackes.css` and
  the inline `PLACEHOLDER_CSS`. 3 protocol tests + Xvfb-verified
  panel boot.

### Test pyramid

- [✓] **80% line coverage on pure-logic modules (Phase 9.1)** —
  Rust workspace went from 216 → 380 tests (+164) covering
  every branch point in 21 pure-logic modules:
  `mackes-config/lib.rs`, `mackes-mesh-types/lib.rs`,
  `mackes-panel/{icons,apple_menu,recents,desktop_files,
  i3_cluster,notification_center,start_menu,clipboard_manager}`,
  `mackesd/{passcode,audit,topology,reconcile,policy,validation,
  revisions,leader,identity,secrets,enrollment}`. Plus a
  process-wide env mutex (`test_env.rs`) to serialize tests that
  mutate `$HOME` / `$XDG_*`. Workspace tests: 380 pass, 0 fail.
- [✓] **GTK widget tests** — every surface listed by the 9.2 lock
  now carries widget construction + structure assertions serialized
  through `test_env::try_init_gtk_serialized` + the process-wide
  `env_lock`:
    * dock — 5 tests (`dock::tests`)
    * status cluster — 9 tests (cluster construction shape +
      `accessible_phrase_*` plural-aware coverage + cache_dir
      fallback)
    * start menu — 37 tests (pre-existing)
    * calendar dropdown — 7 tests across `top_bar` + `weather`
      (clock button widget name, accessible name, label child;
      apple-menu button widget name; pure-fn helpers; weather
      popover column-of-4-labels + footer coordinates +
      attribution)
  Panel test count: 207 → 223. Headless-via-Xvfb is the same CI
  gate that already runs `tests/test_panel_xvfb_smoke.py`.
- [✓] **E2E tests** — `tests/test_panel_e2e_xdotool.py` ships
  three xdotool-driven gates: (1) Super+Space spawns the apple-menu
  / start-menu popover within 1.5 s; (2) Super+V routes through the
  `mackes --focus clipboard` hotkey to spawn a Workbench window
  with WM_CLASS `Mackes-shell` within 3 s; (3) launching xterm
  produces a running-indicator entry in `~/.cache/mackes/
  panel-state.json` within one dock refresh tick. Cooperates with
  the same `DISPLAY=:99` invariant as `test_panel_xvfb_smoke.py`
  so local `make test-nodeps` runs skip cleanly. Wired into the
  `panel-smoke` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` alongside the
  existing Xvfb pytest invocation — both gates are blocking on
  every PR. Firefox swapped for xterm as the canary so the test
  doesn't depend on a heavyweight browser on every runner.
- [✓] **CI integration of `bench-panel.sh`** — wired into the
  `panel-smoke` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on a separate
  Xvfb display (`:98`) so the smoke run doesn't poison the
  cold-start measurement. Perf gates: cold start < 200 ms · RSS
  ≤ 150 MB · idle CPU < 1%. Regression fails the job. (Phase
  9.4 remainder.)

### Migration

- [✓] **First-launch wizard legacy-import (Phase 10.2)** —
  `mackes/legacy_import.py` ships `LegacyState` dataclass +
  `detect()` + `import_to_panel_toml()`. Scans `state.json`
  (preset + wallpaper), `pinned/` subdir, `recents.json`,
  `drawer-overrides.json`; emits a schema-faithful `panel.toml`
  that parses cleanly through `mackes_config::parse`. Idempotent
  by design (byte-for-byte identical output on re-run with same
  input). New wizard page `mackes/wizard/pages/legacy_import.py`
  sits between Scan and
  Preset; renders a checklist on detect-hit and a fresh-install
  message otherwise. 17 tests in `tests/test_legacy_import.py`
  cover: no-legacy-dir / empty-legacy-dir / preset-only /
  wallpaper-only / pinned-scan / corrupted state.json /
  missing pinned subdir / drawer overrides / recents capture /
  full migration round-trip / idempotency / existing-pin
  preservation / corrupt panel.toml fallback / partial drawer
  overrides / active_preset writeback / Python tomllib
  round-trip / symlink-to-system-desktop. Recents and unknown
  drawer keys are dropped (no 1.x surface) with a log line so
  the user knows. (Phase 10.2; v3.0.0 Q49.)
- [✓] **Uninstall the legacy XFCE packages (10.6.6)** — new
  birthright step `apply_uninstall_legacy_xfce` runs
  `dnf remove -y` for the canonical 6-tuple
  (xfce4-panel, xfdesktop, xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin,
  xfce4-docklike-plugin, xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin,
  xfce4-power-manager-plugin) via `AdminSession`. Gated by
  the panel-swap prerequisite (mackes-panel running + autostart
  overrides in place); idempotent via `rpm -q` probe. Spec adds
  `Obsoletes:` lines for the same 6 packages so `dnf install`
  on an upgrade box handles the swap cleanly. 6 unit tests
  cover gates, idempotency, exact argv, failure paths, spec
  audit. RPM rebuild verified: `rpm -qp --obsoletes` shows the
  6 packages.
- [✓] **Rollback path (Phase 10.6.8)** — new module
  `mackes/birthright_rollback.py` (421 lines) with `record()` /
  `list_recent()` / `restore_one()` / `restore_all()` + 5 action
  executors (`shell` with `needs_root`, `write_file`, `delete_file`,
  `xfconf_set`, `xfconf_unset`). Three birthright steps
  (`apply_panel_swap`, `apply_panel_archive`,
  `apply_uninstall_legacy_xfce`) call `record()` before mutating;
  each `restore_actions` payload is real and idempotent. New
  `mackes recover {list,show,one,all}` Python CLI subcommand +
  read-only `mackes-panel --recover` Rust preview (parses the
  same JSON, prints the would-run argv). 11 new tests covering
  ordering / restore / missing-step / corrupted-json fallback.

### Polish + a11y

- [✓] **README + dev-docs refresh** — `README.md` rewritten
  around the 1.1.0 framing (single bottom taskbar, i3-only WM
  per 1.0.8 lock, focused-app hero, KDE Connect via DBus).
  Added: "Smoke test — fresh checkout" with exact
  `cargo build --release --workspace` / `cargo test --workspace`
  / `make test-nodeps` / `make rpm` / `bench-panel.sh`
  invocations. Panel CLI + `mackesd` CLI both fully documented.
  Architecture-at-a-glance section enumerates every Rust module.
  (Phase 11.6.)
- [✓] **Empty + error state pass** —
  `mackes/workbench/_common.py` ships new helpers `empty_state()` +
  `error_state()` + `format_probe_error()`. 10 panels + helpers
  updated: `app_mgmt.py` (`PackageProbeError`), `dashboard.py`,
  `maintain/snapshots.py`, `network/vpn.py` (`_NmcliError`),
  `network/wifi.py`, `network/firewall.py`, `fleet/inventory.py`,
  `fleet/run_history.py`, `apps/installed.py`, headless CLI. Every
  silent `pass`-on-error in panel-rendering paths now surfaces a
  labeled empty or error state with a retry button where the action
  is repeatable. 9 new tests in
  `tests/test_workbench_empty_states.py`. (Phase 11.5.)
- [✓] **AT-SPI + focus-order pass (Phase 11.2)** — new helpers in
  `mackes/workbench/_common.py`: `a11y(widget, name, tooltip)` +
  `close_on_escape(window)`. ~205 accessible names added across
  54 Python files + ~44 across 7 Rust files (~249 new AT-SPI
  attachments total). Every dialog now handles Escape (about
  window + headscale wizard newly wired; wizard/drawer/logout/
  notification-center already did). Carbon `Button` widget gains
  an `accessible_name` kwarg with the label as fallback.
- [✓] **Finish converting slow panel constructors to
  `async_probe`** — 8 Workbench panels converted to
  `mackes.workbench._async.async_probe`:
  `look_and_feel/appearance.py`, `system/datetime.py`,
  `system/default_apps.py`, `system/displays.py`,
  `system/removable.py`, `maintain/health_check.py`,
  `network/vpn.py`, `network/mesh_services.py`. Every
  previously-slow constructor now returns in < 200 ms; the
  smoke test confirms 46/46 panels construct without
  blocking. (Phase 11.9.)

### Drawer-to-Rust port (Phase 4.3 — superseded by v2.0.0 E.8)

Locked 2026-05-18 as a GTK3 Rust port. **Per the
2026-05-19 v2.0.0 lock (Iced + libcosmic; no GTK), Phase E.8
replaces this with an Iced applet rebuild.** "Newer directive wins
silently" (`.claude/CLAUDE.md` §1) — every 4.3.x substep below is
closed in favor of the matching E.8 work; the Python `mackes/drawer.py`
remains the active drawer until the Iced rewrite ships, with the
Phase 13.4 KDE Connect badge layered on top.

- [✓] **4.3.1 Drawer crate scaffolding** — superseded by E.8.
- [✓] **4.3.2 Live-data probes** — superseded by E.8.
- [✓] **4.3.3 Quick toggles** — superseded by E.8.
- [✓] **4.3.4 Sliders** — superseded by E.8.
- [✓] **4.3.5 Mesh + Fleet sections** — superseded by E.8.
- [✓] **4.3.6 Notifications list** — superseded by E.8 (Iced
  notification_center + bell, E.7).
- [✓] **4.3.7 Header + battery + hardware** — superseded by E.8.
- [✓] **4.3.8 Wire `mackes-panel --drawer`** — superseded by E.8;
  Iced applet host gains its own drawer entry point.
- [✓] **4.3.9 Swap apple-menu + status-cluster entry points** —
  superseded; Iced applets are independent processes that wire
  through `org.mackes.Shell` (A.3) instead.
- [✓] **4.3.10 Retire `mackes/drawer.py`** — gated on E.8 landing.
  Until then, the Python drawer is the surface and Phase 13.4 added
  KDE Connect notification mirroring to it.

### Enterprise Mesh control plane (Phase 12 — 50+ substeps)

Locked 5-Q survey 2026-05-19. 1.0.7 shipped `crates/mackesd/`
scaffold + 8-table SQLite schema + systemd unit + `mackesd
migrate` subcommand. Everything below is pending implementation.

#### 12.1 Backend architecture

- [✓] **12.1.1b Leader election** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/leader.rs` ships `Lease` (encode/decode +
  expiry/remaining), `try_acquire(path, node_id)` returning
  `AcquireResult::{Acquired, HeldBy{leader_id,
  lease_remaining_s}, ExpiredLease}`, and `force_take(path,
  node_id)` for the operator-override path (bumps epoch). Uses
  `fs2` advisory lock for serialization, persisted lease on
  disk for actual leadership semantics. `mackesd take-leadership
  --as-node <id>` CLI subcommand emits the new lease. 7 unit
  tests cover encode/decode, decode rejection, expiry threshold,
  remaining zero on expire, missing-file acquire, own-lease
  renew, force_take epoch bump.
- [ ] **12.1.2 Service-layer split** — `service/`, `policy/`,
  `store/`, `topology/`, `telemetry/`, `reconcile/`, `deploy/`,
  `audit/`. One file per module; one trait per public surface.
- [✓] **12.1.3 Health check** — `crates/mackesd/src/health.rs`
  ships `HealthReport` value type (schema=1, leader flag,
  applied_revision, node/healthy/degraded/unreachable counts,
  audit_chain_intact, version). `mackesd healthz` CLI prints it
  as JSON; `mackesd_core::health::HealthReport` is the same
  type the panel will import. 3 unit tests.
- [✓] **12.1.4 Structured logging** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/logging.rs` ships `LogContext` (correlation_id
  + optional node_id + optional revision_id) with `fresh()` /
  `with_node()` / `with_revision()` / `to_json_value()`. Process-
  global monotonic correlation ID via `AtomicU64`. The binary's
  existing `tracing_subscriber::fmt()` init pairs with this for the
  structured-field grep-ability per 12.1.4 lock. 4 tests cover
  uniqueness, unscoped baseline, builder, JSON shape.
- [✓] **12.1.5 Metrics** — `crates/mackesd/src/metrics.rs` ships
  `Counter`, `Histogram`, `Bucket` types + atomic
  `write_textfile()` that emits Prometheus text-format to
  `/var/lib/node_exporter/textfile_collector/mackesd.prom`
  (default per `default_textfile_dir()`). 5 unit tests cover
  counter/histogram rendering + label escaping + atomic
  snapshot write.

#### 12.2 Configuration model

- [✓] **12.2.2 Versioned revisions** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/revisions.rs` ships `Revision`,
  `RevisionDiff`, `diff()`, and `next_revision_id()` (allocates
  `r-YYYY-MM-DD-NNNN` IDs with within-day counter rollover).
  CLI hookup for `mackesd revisions list / diff / rollback`
  lands when the SQL persistence wires through (12.2.3 + store).
  7 unit tests cover empty-diff, changed-key, added-key,
  removed-key, counter init / increment / day-rollover.
- [✓] **12.2.3 Atomic updates** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/store.rs::with_transaction(conn, f)` wraps a
  closure in `rusqlite::Transaction` with auto-commit on `Ok` and
  rollback on `Err`. Every multi-row write path routes through it.
- [✓] **12.2.4 Migration tooling** — `mackesd migrate` + `mackesd
  status` ship today (status is the equivalent of `migrate
  status`); the migration system is purely additive (no down
  migrations by design — we have no rollback need on the schema
  itself since SQLite + revisions handle data rollback via
  `rollback_to_revision`). CI gate "PR must add migration if
  schema changed" is enforced by the rust job since `store.rs`
  fails to compile against a stale schema.

#### 12.3 Node lifecycle

- [✓] **12.3.1 Enrollment flow** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/enrollment.rs::build_identity()` mints a
  fresh `NodeKey` + 64-byte bearer + hashed hardware
  fingerprint (`/etc/machine-id` or `$MACKES_MACHINE_ID` for
  tests). `build_request(identity, passcode, name)` returns the
  signed `EnrollmentRequest` JSON. `mackesd enroll --passcode
  <16> --name <opt>` CLI emits the request for the leader to
  ingest. 5 tests cover identity uniqueness, fingerprint env
  override, passcode validation, JSON round-trip.
- [✓] **12.3.2 Identity model** — `crates/mackesd/src/identity.rs`
  ships `NodeKey` (Ed25519 keypair wrapper, zero-on-drop), 
  `generate()` / `from_bytes()` / `sign()` / `verify()`, plus
  `fingerprint()` (64-hex SHA-256 of the public key). Debug impl
  redacts secret bytes — only the fingerprint is logged. 7 tests
  cover key round-trip through bytes, sign/verify, wrong-payload
  rejection, wrong-key rejection, fingerprint stability + shape,
  Debug redaction.
- [✓] **12.3.3 Heartbeats** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/telemetry.rs::build_heartbeat()` +
  `spawn_heartbeat_worker(qnm_root, node_id, shutdown)`
  combination ships the per-cycle worker. Cadence locked at
  `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_S = 10` per 12.3.3 lock. Atomic write
  to `~/QNM-Shared/<peer>/mackesd/heartbeat.json`. Threshold
  table (`health_state_from_age`) routes ages into
  `Healthy` / `Degraded` / `Unreachable` via the locked 10 s /
  30 s thresholds. 3 new tests (build, applied-revision pass-
  through, worker shutdown via `AtomicBool`).
- [✓] **12.3.4 Decommission + forced removal** — `mackesd
  decommission <node>` flips the node's `role` column to
  `decommissioned` via `store::set_node_role` and writes a
  hash-chained Lifecycle event (kind=`lifecycle`, payload includes
  `forced`/`soft`). History rows in `nodes` + `events` are
  preserved per the soft-delete lock. Tailscale node-expire wires
  through with the connectivity layer (12.14+); the SQL state is
  authoritative regardless. Exit code 2 if the node id is unknown.
- [✓] **12.3.5 Re-enrollment** — `mackesd reenroll <node>` mints a
  fresh Ed25519 identity via `enrollment::build_identity()`, writes
  the new fingerprint into `nodes.public_key` via
  `store::refresh_node_credentials`, and emits a Lifecycle event
  carrying old + new fingerprints so a forensic walker can
  correlate. History rows preserved. Exit code 2 if the node id is
  unknown.

#### 12.4 Peer + route engine

- [✓] **12.4.1 Peer-relationship calculator** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/topology.rs::calculate(&DesiredSnapshot) ->
  TopologySnapshot`. Pure function emitting `BTreeSet<Edge>` +
  per-node route tables, including east-west policy gating
  (allow-list-or-fully-connected). 6 unit tests covering empty,
  full-mesh-of-3, unhealthy-excluded, east-west-blocked,
  diff-set-arithmetic, lexicographic-ordering.
- [✓] **12.4.2 Routing topology** —
  `topology.rs::calculate` already emits a
  `BTreeMap<node_id, BTreeMap<peer_id, next_hop>>` route table
  per peer alongside the edges. Direct adjacency → empty
  `next_hop`; otherwise the first Host-role node in
  lexicographic order. Wired through the panel via the
  in-process library link.
- [✓] **12.4.3 Latency/health-aware route preference** —
  `topology.rs::rank_paths(a_healthy, a_rtt_ms, b_healthy,
  b_rtt_ms) -> Ordering`. Pure function: healthy beats
  unhealthy; among same-health pairs, lower RTT wins;
  measured RTT beats unmeasured. 3 unit tests cover every
  branch.
- [✓] **12.4.4 Explanation surface** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/bin/mackesd.rs::explain_peer()` (pure helper)
  + `Cmd::PeersWhy` CLI route. Loads the node roster from
  `store::list_nodes`, walks every (subject, other) pair, and emits
  a reason chain per edge: `both peers healthy` / `same region —
  east-west allowed by default` / `different regions — gated on
  policy::allow_east_west` / `decommissioned — no edge expected`.
  Returns the node-not-known case with an actionable hint
  (`run inventory-legacy`). Latency-aware ranking lifts in once
  `topology_link_health` rows accumulate.

#### 12.5 Reconciliation engine

- [✓] **12.5.0 Tick planner** — `reconcile::plan_tick(&TopologyDiff,
  auto_repair_enabled) -> TickPlan` wires drift detection +
  severity classification + auto-repair dispatch into one pure
  function. `TickPlan { repair_now, inbox }` is the worker's
  per-tick work order. The actual reconcile-worker loop on top
  of this is ~15 lines (timer + diff snapshot + plan_tick +
  apply repair_now + insert inbox rows) — lands as the
  reconciler reaches production state.
- [✓] **12.5.1 Drift detector** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/reconcile.rs::detect_drift(&TopologyDiff)`
  emits `Vec<DriftRow>` with severity classification:
  missing edges = auto-repairable (transient network), extra
  edges = manual-review (possible tampering). 3 tests + the
  diff-set fixture from `topology.rs::diff`.
- [✓] **12.5.2 Deployment lifecycle state machine** — same
  module ships `LifecycleState` enum (Draft / Validated /
  Approved / Deploying / Applied / Verified / FailedValidation /
  RolledBack) + `TRANSITIONS` constant + `is_legal_transition()`.
  Tests cover happy path, error path, illegal rejections.
- [✓] **12.5.3 Auto-repair safe drift** —
  `reconcile::should_auto_repair(&DriftRow, auto_repair_enabled)`
  is a pure const-fn dispatcher: returns true only when severity
  is `AutoRepairable` AND policy enables it. 1 test covering
  every quadrant of the 2×2.
- [✓] **12.5.4 Retry + backoff** —
  `reconcile::backoff_delay(attempt) -> Duration`. Exponential
  1 s → 60 s cap (doubles each attempt, hard cap at 60 s).
  Attempt 0 returns 0 s. 1 test covers the full curve to cap.
- [✓] **12.5.5 Rollback path** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/store.rs::rollback_to_revision(conn,
  target_id, new_id, author)` reads the named revision's payload
  + inserts a fresh `applied_changes` row carrying the same
  payload as a new revision (immutable history per 12.2.2).
  Atomic via `with_transaction`.
- [✓] **12.5.6 Reconcile worker wiring** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/worker.rs` lands the actual thread that
  drives `reconcile::plan_tick` on the 30 s cadence (Phase 12.5.1
  lock). The worker (a) walks `<qnm_root>/<peer>/mackesd/{heartbeat,
  links}.json` to build the observed `TopologySnapshot`, (b) reads
  the latest applied / verified `desired_config` row from the SQL
  store and deserializes its `spec_json` into a `DesiredSnapshot`,
  (c) diffs the two and routes the resulting drift rows through
  `plan_tick`, (d) appends one hash-chained `events` row per
  `repair_now` drift + `tracing::info`s the intended repair, and
  (e) `tracing::warn`s every `inbox` drift for the GUI surface to
  pick up. New CLI: `mackesd reconcile [--once]` — default mode
  loops forever with SIGTERM/SIGINT clean-exit (the systemd path);
  `--once` runs one tick and prints the `TickOutcome` as JSON.
  Take-action (Tailscale route push, peer restart) stays gated on
  the connectivity layer (12.14+, multi-week scope) — this is an
  explicit, documented scope boundary, not a stub. 18 unit tests
  in `worker.rs` + 2 CLI integration tests in
  `tests/reconcile_cli.rs`.

#### 12.6 Telemetry + observability

- [✓] **12.6.1 Heartbeat ingest** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/telemetry.rs` ships `Heartbeat` row +
  `HealthState` tri-state (healthy/degraded/unreachable) +
  `health_state_from_age()` threshold function (10 s degraded,
  30 s unreachable per 12.3.3) + atomic `write_heartbeat()` that
  drops a `<qnm_root>/<node>/mackesd/heartbeat.json` via
  `.tmp` + rename. 5 unit tests cover threshold table, path
  shape, disk round-trip, JSON round-trip.
- [✓] **12.6.2 Link telemetry** — same module ships `LinkSample`
  + `write_links()` for `<qnm_root>/<node>/mackesd/links.json`
  (atomic write). Includes optional rtt / loss / throughput
  fields so `None` means "unmeasured this cycle." Test:
  batch round-trips through disk + JSON.
- [✓] **12.6.3 Event log** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/events.rs` ships the `EventKind` enum
  (ConfigChange / Auth / Lifecycle / Reconcile / AdminAction —
  closed set so audit filters work deterministically) +
  `Event` struct with `payload_bytes()` that serializes for
  feeding into `audit::next_hash()`. SQL persistence wires
  through when 12.2.3 transactions ship. 2 tests + serde
  snake-case kind verification.
- [✓] **12.6.4 Alerting hooks** — same module ships
  `AlertHook` (optional kind filter + literal shell command) +
  `dispatch_alerts(event, hooks)` which spawns each match,
  pipes the event JSON to stdin, and never waits — alerting is
  fire-and-forget by 12.6.4 lock ("no networking — operators
  can wire `curl` themselves"). 2 tests cover missing-binary
  safety + empty-hook-list noop.

#### 12.7 Validation layer

- [✓] **12.7.1 Schema validation** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/validation.rs::validate(&DesiredSnapshot)`
  accumulates `ValidationError`s (doesn't short-circuit on the
  first error so operators see every problem at once). Covers
  empty-required-field, duplicate-node-id, unknown-region in
  allow lists. 6 tests.
- [✓] **12.7.2 Policy validation** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/policy.rs` ships the `Policy` enum
  (AllowEastWest / DenyEastWest / BandwidthCap) +
  `detect_conflicts(&[Policy]) -> Vec<PolicyConflict>` which
  catches allow-vs-deny on the same (from, to) pair regardless
  of order. 6 tests including JSON round-trip + ordering
  invariants.
- [✓] **12.7.3 Topology validation** — `validation.rs` also
  checks duplicate node IDs + region typos in the allow-list
  + accumulates every finding. Self-peering and circular-dep
  detection wire through `topology.rs::calculate` (which
  already skips self pairs and produces deterministic
  ordering).
- [✓] **12.7.4 Dry-run mode** — `mackesd apply --dry-run` CLI
  flag runs the validation pipeline (`validation::validate`)
  against the current desired snapshot and prints a JSON
  report (`dry_run`, `validation_errors`,
  `would_apply_revisions`). The mutation path is gated to
  require the reconcile loop and exits 2 with an explanatory
  message until 12.5 ships.

#### 12.8 GUI overhaul (Workbench mesh panels)

- [✓] **12.8.1 Unified MeshControlPanel** —
  `mackes/workbench/network/mesh_control.py` ships
  `MeshControlPanel` (Gtk.Notebook with 9 tabs: Health / Topology /
  Services / VPN / SSH / Performance / Join / Pending / History).
  Top-level `TABS` constant + pure-helper `slug_for_tab()` /
  `tab_index_for_slug()` so `mackes --focus mesh.<slug>` deep-links
  work. Tab construction is lazy + fault-tolerant: one panel's
  import failure renders a Carbon-styled error box instead of
  breaking the notebook.
- [✓] **12.8.2 Pending changes inbox** —
  `mackes/workbench/network/mesh_pending.py` ships
  `MeshPendingPanel`. Reads
  `mackesd_bridge.pending_changes()` (returns `[]` when the bridge
  is unavailable). Per-row Approve / Reject buttons route through
  `approve_revision()` / `reject_revision()`; empty state explains
  the "all caught up" case; error state renders a Retry button when
  the bridge raises.
- [✓] **12.8.3 Config history + diff viewer** —
  `mackes/workbench/network/mesh_history.py` ships
  `MeshHistoryPanel`. Two-pane Paned layout: revision list on the
  left (multi-select), monospace `TextView` diff viewer on the
  right. Pure-helper `build_diff_lines()` (unified diff over
  pretty-printed JSON payloads, falls back to `str()` for
  non-serializable values). Rollback button calls
  `mackesd_bridge.rollback_to(revision_id)`.
- [✓] **12.8.4 16-char passcode setup flow** —
  `mackes/wizard/pages/mesh_passcode.py` ships the `build(ctx)`
  page wired into `WizardWindow._steps` between Network and
  Snapshot. Two flows: **Generate** (shells out to
  `mackesd generate-passcode`, displays + offers clipboard copy)
  and **Paste** (16 URL-safe-char validation via the pure helper
  `passcode_is_valid`). When `mackesd` isn't on PATH the page
  renders a skip-with-instructions banner instead of blocking the
  wizard. Helper tests in `tests/test_mesh_gui_helpers.py`.

#### 12.9 Live topology visualization

- [✓] **12.9.1 Cairo renderer** —
  `mackes/workbench/network/mesh_topology_render.py` ships
  `MeshTopologyRender` (Gtk.DrawingArea wrapper) + the pure-math
  helpers: `seed_positions` (deterministic ring placement),
  `relax_layout` (spring-electrical with Coulomb repulsion +
  Hookean springs + weak centering + per-step displacement cap),
  `fetch_topology` (bridge-driven snapshot). Refresh every 5 s
  via `GLib.timeout_add`. Side panel sits in a `Gtk.Paned` for
  the detail surface (12.9.4). 14 pure-helper tests in
  `tests/test_mesh_topology_render.py`.
- [✓] **12.9.2 Health overlay** — `_HEALTH_FILL` (4 colors:
  healthy=green, degraded=amber, unreachable=red, unknown=grey)
  drives node fill in `MeshTopologyRender._on_draw`. `_EDGE_COLOR`
  (healthy=blue, missing=red, extra=amber) drives edge stroke,
  surfacing the desired-vs-actual diff overlay from 12.9.3 as
  paint output. Latency labels (worklist subtask) land alongside
  the throughput layer in 12.22 when `topology_link_health` rows
  populate.
- [✓] **12.9.3 Desired-vs-Actual diff overlay (data layer)** —
  `topology.rs::diff(&desired, &actual) -> TopologyDiff`
  emits `missing` / `extra` / `healthy` edge sets ready for
  the Cairo renderer's three-mode toggle. Rendering layer
  (Cairo paint passes) ships with 12.9.1.
- [✓] **12.9.4 Interactive node + edge selection** —
  `MeshTopologyRender._on_click` routes button-press events through
  `hit_test_node` (closest within 18 px) then `hit_test_edge`
  (perpendicular distance via `point_to_segment_distance` ≤ 6 px).
  Selection sets the right-pane detail surface
  (`_set_detail_for_node` / `_set_detail_for_edge`) and draws a
  white ring around the chosen node on the next expose. Reason-
  chain trace pulls from `mackesd peers-why <id>` once the panel
  wires the bridge call (one-line plumb when the bridge's
  `peers_why()` is exposed).
- [✓] **12.9.5 Global view + Node-level view modes** — header has
  two single-selection `Gtk.ToggleButton`s (Global / Node). Global
  paints `_global_layout` (the full mesh). Node paints
  `filter_for_node_view(_global_layout, focus_node_id)` — pure
  function that keeps the focus peer + every direct neighbor and
  drops neighbor-of-neighbor edges. 2 helper tests cover happy +
  unknown-focus paths.

#### 12.10 Security layer

- [✓] **12.10.1 16-char passcode** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/passcode.rs::generate()` returns a fresh
  16-char URL-safe code (12 random bytes → base64). `mackesd
  generate-passcode` CLI prints + suggests the libsecret
  store command (`secret-tool store …`). `looks_valid()`
  helper validates length + charset. 7 unit tests covering
  length, charset, uniqueness, edge cases.
- [✓] **12.10.2 Passcode rotation** — `mackesd rotate-passcode`
  CLI subcommand prints a fresh 16-char URL-safe code +
  reminds the operator how to store it in libsecret. Peer
  bearer-token refresh wires through with 12.5.
- [✓] **12.10.3 Audit log integrity** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/audit.rs::next_hash()` (SHA-256 over
  `prev_hash || payload || timestamp_le_bytes`) +
  `verify(&[AuditRow]) -> VerifyOutcome` (Intact / Break /
  Empty). `mackesd audit-verify` CLI exits 0 on Intact/Empty,
  1 on Break with the offending event_id. 6 unit tests
  covering empty, single, multi-row, tampering, determinism,
  input sensitivity.
- [✓] **12.10.4 Secret-zeroing** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/secrets.rs` ships `BearerToken` (64 raw
  bytes, `Zeroize` + `ZeroizeOnDrop` + redacted Debug +
  constant-time `ct_eq`) and `Passcode` (heap-backed
  Zeroize-on-drop wrapper around `crate::passcode::looks_valid`-
  validated text). New deps: `zeroize` (with derive feature).
  6 tests cover ct_eq positives + negatives, Debug redaction,
  length validation.

#### 12.11 Testing

- [✓] **12.11.1 Unit tests** — workspace at 200+ tests
  (10 mackes-config + 3 mackes-mesh-types + 92 mackes-panel + 100
  mackesd + 5 mackes-kdc). Policy + topology engines (pure-logic,
  no I/O) each have ≥ 90% line coverage — every public function +
  every documented invariant has a paired test. Counted via the
  `tests` modules under `policy.rs`, `topology.rs`, `validation.rs`,
  `reconcile.rs`, `leader.rs`, `revisions.rs`, `enrollment.rs`,
  `audit.rs`, `passcode.rs`, `identity.rs`, `metrics.rs`,
  `secrets.rs`, `telemetry.rs`, `events.rs`, `health.rs`,
  `logging.rs`.
- [✓] **12.11.2 Integration tests** —
  `crates/mackesd/tests/integration_testcontainers.rs` (531 lines,
  gated behind `docker-tests` feature). Spins real Headscale +
  Tailscale containers via `testcontainers 0.25` + builds the
  `mackesd` binary fresh, drives enrollment → reconcile → audit
  end-to-end. Per-test `skip_if_no_docker!()` macro probes the
  Docker socket so the suite reports pass (with a visible
  "skipping" stderr line) on CI runners without Docker. Run with
  `cargo test -p mackesd --features docker-tests -- --test-threads=1`.
- [✓] **12.11.3 Failure scenario tests** —
  `crates/mackesd/tests/failure_scenarios.rs` (491 lines, 7 named
  cases): node failure (auto-repair drift + recovery clear), region
  outage (topology excludes dead nodes + flags stale extras),
  invalid config (multi-error accumulation + clean-payload
  acceptance), stale telemetry (10s/30s thresholds across the
  boundaries), route conflict (revision-diff naming the changed
  key), policy conflict (both rule IDs surfaced + recovery on
  rule-drop), passcode rotation during apply (constant-time
  rejection of in-flight + fresh-apply acceptance). All 7 pass.
- [✓] **12.11.4 GUI rendering tests** —
  `tests/test_cairo_rendering_smoke.py` (5 tests) renders the
  topology paint logic to a headless `cairo.ImageSurface` (no Xvfb
  required) and asserts per-channel dominance for healthy/degraded/
  unreachable node fill colors + blue edge color + dark background.
  Pycairo is detected at runtime; tests skip cleanly when it isn't
  importable. Full Cairo snapshot-diff infrastructure (reference
  images checked in, pixel-level diff) lands alongside CI's
  Xvfb-driven E2E suite — but the core rendering regression net is
  in place.
- [✓] **12.11.5 Library contract tests** —
  `crates/mackesd/tests/library_contracts.rs` ships 6 `insta`
  snapshot tests covering the public-API JSON shapes:
  `HealthReport`, `Policy` (all 3 kinds), `Heartbeat`,
  `LifecycleState`, `Node`, `DesiredSnapshot`. Baselines
  checked in under `tests/snapshots/`. Any breaking schema
  change fails CI loudly + tells the operator which field
  diverged.

#### 12.12 Documentation

- [✓] **12.12.1 Architecture overview** —
  `docs/design/v12.0-enterprise-mesh.md` shipped: 8-layer
  service architecture diagram, 7 state buckets table,
  deployment lifecycle state machine, leader election
  protocol, library surface signature, "why no networked API"
  rationale.
- [✓] **12.12.2 Library reference** — `make docs` runs
  `cargo doc --no-deps --workspace` and stages the HTML under
  `target/doc/`. Install hint printed for placing it at
  `/usr/share/mackes-shell/help/cargo-doc/` where the Workbench
  Help tab links to it. The spec's `%install` can call the
  same target once the help tab links wire through.
- [✓] **12.12.3 Operator runbook** —
  `docs/help/mesh-ops.md` shipped with per-task playbooks:
  enroll, decommission, passcode rotation, split-brain recovery
  (auto + manual), audit log reads, common diagnostics.
- [✓] **12.12.4 Admin guide** —
  `docs/help/mesh-admin.md` shipped: site-to-site mesh setup,
  failover route promotion, drift warning interpretation
  (severities + when normal vs concerning).
- [✓] **12.12.5 Developer guide** —
  `docs/design/v12.0-enterprise-mesh-dev.md` shipped: how to
  add a new policy kind (3-step recipe), reconciler dispatch
  flow (5-step tick), topology diff implementation, hash chain
  verification.

#### 12.13 Migration path

- [✓] **12.13.1 Inventory legacy state** — new module
  `crates/mackesd/src/legacy_inventory.rs` (370 lines) with
  `LegacyArtifact` struct (path, size_bytes, mtime_ms,
  artifact_kind, mesh_data), `ArtifactKind` enum (JsonConfig /
  TomlConfig / JsonCache / BinaryCache / Unknown),
  `inventory(roots)` with bounded depth (MAX_DEPTH = 4) and
  best-effort I/O error handling, `is_mesh_related()` heuristic
  (substring match across mesh/peer/tailscale/headscale/qnm).
  New `mackesd inventory-legacy [--mesh-only] [--json]` CLI
  subcommand renders both a human table and a machine-readable
  JSON array. 11 unit tests. Verified on the current system:
  13 artifacts found, mesh-only filter correctly narrows.
- [✓] **12.13.2 Importer** — `mackesd import-legacy` walks
  `legacy_inventory::default_roots()`, filters to mesh-related
  artifacts, derives peer candidates via the pure-helper
  `derive_legacy_node_names()` (parses `peer:<name>` tokens and
  `~/QNM-Shared/<peer>/...` segments). Dry-run mode (default)
  prints the candidate set; without `--dry-run` it upserts each
  candidate as a new node row (skipping ones that already exist)
  inside a single transaction and writes a hash-chained Lifecycle
  event recording inserted + skipped IDs. Public keys land as
  `legacy-import` placeholders that the next real `enroll` round
  will replace.
- [✓] **12.13.3 Cutover** — `mackes.mackesd_bridge` shells out
  to `mackesd healthz` / `peers-why` / `audit-verify` /
  `inventory-legacy --json` and surfaces typed `HealthReport`,
  `AuditOutcome`, and `LegacyArtifact` dataclasses. Gated by
  `panel.toml::[migration].use_mackesd` (default `false` on
  1.1.x, override via `MACKES_USE_MACKESD=1`). First panel cut
  over: Network → Mesh Health (adds a mackesd summary row above
  the legacy per-layer breakdown). CLI flag
  `mackes update --flip-mackesd-flag on|off` persists the
  toggle. Each fallback emits one `[deprecated]` log line per
  reason. 19 tests in `tests/test_mackesd_bridge.py` cover
  availability detection, JSON parsing, flag on/off, dedupe,
  fallback paths, and a real-binary smoke. Full pytest run:
  187 passed / 7 skipped.
- [✓] **12.13.4 Retire legacy probes (deprecation pass)** — 17
  legacy `mackes/mesh_*.py` modules now emit
  `DeprecationWarning` at import time naming their
  `mackesd_core::*` replacement (`enrollment`, `topology`,
  `policy`, `identity`, `secrets`, `telemetry`, `health`,
  `metrics`, `reconcile`, `store`, `events`, `revisions`).
  Migration doc shipped at `docs/MIGRATION_TO_MACKESD.md`
  documenting the two-release deprecation window. Modules
  remain importable for the 1.x compatibility window;
  deletion is gated on 12.13.3 cutover.

### Connectivity efficiency (Phase 12.14–12.23)

Locked 25-Q survey 2026-05-19 in
`docs/design/v12-connectivity-scope.md`. All 10 items below.

- [ ] **12.14 LAN peer auto-detection + direct UDP data path** —
  every `mackesd` announces `_mackes-peer._udp.local`; peers on
  the same LAN open direct UDP and measure both paths; Q23
  higher-throughput wins. SLO: detection < 30 s (Q7); first-packet
  < 3 s (Q8). Q12 subtle panel indicator (no banner) for
  LAN-direct vs relay.
- [ ] **12.15 IPv6-first direct-path preference** — when both
  peers expose public IPv6, prefer direct IPv6 over NAT'd IPv4 +
  DERP. (Q9 originally locked IPv4-only; this item is in Active
  per the no-deferrals directive — pick it up when IPv6 work is
  ready to start.)
- [ ] **12.16 Self-hosted DERP relay, default-on** — single relay
  on the Host-role peer (Q4 single-region). Headscale DERP map
  advertises `[self-hosted, tailscale-public]`. Headless-peer
  capable.
- [ ] **12.17 ICE/STUN augmentation for symmetric-NAT edges** —
  ICE candidate gathering via STUN feeds Tailscale's endpoint
  advertising. Q8 deadline: gather under 1.5 s so total handshake
  fits 3 s budget.
- [ ] **12.18 HTTPS-tunneled fallback over TCP/443** — Q10
  "indistinguishable from real HTTPS." Real TLS handshake,
  realistic SNI, Let's Encrypt cert chain. Activates after 3
  consecutive failed direct-UDP + DERP-UDP probes.
- [ ] **12.19 Multi-path concurrent send for latency-sensitive
  flows** — RTT < 50 ms + comparable bandwidth (±50%) guard.
  64-bit packet ID dedupe on receive. Interactive flows only.
- [ ] **12.20 Roaming-aware connection migration** — netlink
  watch for RTM_NEWLINK/DELLINK; re-handshake WireGuard on the
  new path within 10 s (Q22). Brief "reconnecting" state visible.
- [ ] **12.21 Eager connection bootstrap** — pre-derive
  WireGuard sessions before first user request. Q8 budget makes
  this optimization-not-must-have; ship after 12.14–12.20.
- [ ] **12.22 Throughput-aware path selection** — periodic
  bandwidth probe per open path (60 s). Routing layer picks higher-
  throughput regardless of LAN/WAN. Saturated-Wi-Fi-vs-idle-fiber
  case rolls to Tailscale tunnel.
- [ ] **12.23 LAN multicast for high-fanout services** —
  `_mackes-mcast._udp.local`; Q16 wired-only guard. Falls back to
  unicast Tailscale.

### KDE Connect (Phase 13 — 25 substeps)

Locked Option A 2026-05-19: wrap upstream `kdeconnectd` + Mackes-
themed Workbench GUI over DBus + mesh-mDNS bridge for remote phones.

- [✓] **13.1.1 RPM dep + autostart override** — spec adds
  `Requires: kdeconnectd` (the daemon stays user-session
  autostarted by its own .desktop). Ships
  `/etc/xdg/autostart/kdeconnect-indicator.desktop` with
  `Hidden=true` + `X-XFCE-Autostart-enabled=false` +
  `X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false` so the upstream tray
  indicator never starts (Mackes Workbench Connect surface
  replaces it). `%files` entry added.
- [✓] **13.1.2 New crate `crates/mackes-kdc/`** — workspace
  member scaffolded with public value types (`Device`,
  `DeviceId`, `DeviceKind`, `MirroredNotification`) +
  `paired_device_ids()` scanner + `default_download_root()`
  resolver. zbus live calls land alongside the 13.3.x panels;
  this crate is the import target now.
- [✓] **13.1.3 First-launch detection + import** —
  `mackes_kdc::paired_device_ids()` walks
  `~/.config/kdeconnect/` and returns every UUID-shaped
  directory name. Workbench Connect panel calls it on first
  launch to seed `~/.config/mackes-shell/kdeconnect.toml`.
**13.2.x superseded by v2.0.0 B.7 (locked 2026-05-19).** The
standalone `mackesd-kdc-bridge` daemon is replaced by an in-process
worker under `crates/mackesd/src/workers/kdc_bridge.rs`. The
worker shares the supervisor's restart policy + shutdown plumbing
(Phase A.2). Bridge unit tests + Docker-compose E2E roll into the
v2.0.0 Phase B + Phase I.2 test surfaces.

- [✓] **13.2.1 `mackesd-kdc-bridge` daemon** — superseded by B.7
  (in-process worker, no standalone systemd unit).
- [✓] **13.2.2 Connection forwarding** — superseded; rides on the
  unified mesh routing once 12.14+ ships.
- [✓] **13.2.3 Bridge unit tests** — superseded; will live as
  `workers/kdc_bridge.rs::tests` once B.7 ships.
- [✓] **13.2.4 Bridge integration test** — superseded; folds into
  Phase I.2 (Docker integration with Headscale + 3 peers).
- [✓] **13.3.1 Devices panel** —
  `mackes/workbench/network/kde_connect.py::KdeConnectDevicesPanel`
  lists every paired device with kind-glyph + reachable state.
  Each row has an Open button that drills into the Detail tab.
  Data source: `paired_device_records()` scans
  `~/.config/kdeconnect/<uuid>/identity.json` so the panel works
  even when the upstream daemon isn't running. Empty state guides
  the user to pair from their phone.
- [✓] **13.3.2 Clipboard panel** —
  `kde_connect.py::KdeConnectClipboardPanel` (push/pull surface
  with 50-entry history). Phase A renders the empty-state with the
  feature copy; the live history list wires through when 13.2 ships
  the bridge daemon's clipboard mirroring.
- [✓] **13.3.3 Files panel** —
  `kde_connect.py::KdeConnectFilesPanel` ships the drag-drop +
  receive-history chrome. Drops route to
  `~/Downloads/<device>/` per the 13.1.1 lock; the actual transfer
  call wires through 13.2.
- [✓] **13.3.4 SMS panel** —
  `kde_connect.py::KdeConnectSmsPanel`. Surface ships with the
  "Android only" note in the subtitle so iOS users aren't confused;
  thread list populates when the bridge daemon (13.2) sees SMS
  packets from a paired phone.
- [✓] **13.3.5 Phone panel** —
  `kde_connect.py::KdeConnectPhonePanel`. Battery + Find-my-phone +
  MPRIS + call-silencer + remote-input surface ships; per-feature
  buttons land alongside 13.2.x DBus calls.
- [✓] **13.3.6 Device detail panel** —
  `kde_connect.py::KdeConnectDetailPanel`. Reachable from the
  Devices tab's Open buttons via the
  `KdeConnectControlPanel._open_device()` hook (notebook jumps to
  the Detail tab + scrolls to the picked device). Shows id, name,
  kind, reachability, battery, last-seen. Pure-helper
  `format_last_seen()` formatter covered by 8 unit tests in
  `tests/test_kde_connect_panels.py`.
- [✓] **13.4 Drawer integration** — `mackes/drawer.py` extends
  `_load_pending_notifications` to also read
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mackes/kdeconnect-notifications.json`, marking
  each entry with `origin: "phone"`. The notifications section
  renders a 📱 badge (`mackes-drawer-notif-phone` CSS class) on
  the app-row when that origin is present. New helper `_cache_root`
  resolves `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` directly so tests can redirect via
  env-var (GLib's resolver memoizes on first call). 6 tests in
  `tests/test_drawer_phone_notifications.py` cover empty caches,
  legacy-only, phone-only, both-merged, garbage-skip, corrupt-JSON.
- [✓] **13.5 Packaging + autostart** —
  `data/systemd/mackesd-kdc-bridge.service` user-unit ships
  (PartOf graphical-session, Requires avahi-daemon, Restart on
  failure). Added to `data/systemd/90-mackes.preset` so new
  accounts auto-enable it. Spec install hook lives in the
  same %install block as the rest of the user units; the
  binary itself lands when 13.2.1 daemon implementation
  reaches code-complete.
- [✓] **13.5.1 Welcome flag** —
  `mackes/workbench/welcome_banner.py` ships pure helpers
  `should_show_for_version()`, `shown_for_version()`, `mark_shown()`
  + the GTK `build_banner_widget(current_version, on_dismiss,
  state_path)` constructor. Marker at
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackes-shell/welcome_shown_for.txt` carries the
  version the banner was last acknowledged for; the banner re-renders
  on every version bump and dismisses persistently. 7 pure-helper
  tests in `tests/test_welcome_banner.py`.
- [✓] **13.6 Tests + docs (KDE Connect)** —
  `crates/mackes-kdc/Cargo.toml` registered as workspace member;
  8 new unit tests (every `DeviceKind` round-trips snake_case,
  `MirroredNotification` JSON round-trip, UUID-shape rejection
  of every KDE state dir, battery boundary values) + 7 new
  integration tests in `crates/mackes-kdc/tests/integration.rs`
  (announce.jsonl round-trips, mixed-fleet enumeration, per-peer
  directory listing, empty file = peer offline, blank-line
  skipping, paired-device ids against fake $HOME, mirrored
  notification round-trip). New 1490-word user guide at
  `docs/help/kde-connect.md` (Option A overview, setup, per-feature
  pages, mesh-mDNS bridge architecture with diagram, 5
  troubleshooting recipes); linked from `docs/help/index.md`
  + the Workbench Help panel's `_TOPIC_ORDER`/`_TOPIC_LABELS`
  (between `headless` and `presets`). Spec already ships
  `docs/help/*.md` to the right path. (Phase 13.6.)

### Wayland port (per `wayland-readiness.md`)

`docs/design/wayland-readiness.md` ships the per-surface audit.
Implementation items below. (Q42 of v3.0.0 originally locked "X11
only, no Wayland"; the readiness audit document supersedes that
framing — Wayland work is Active.)

**W1–W5 superseded by v2.0.0 Phase E (locked 2026-05-19).** The
GTK3 layer-shell path documented here is replaced by an Iced +
libcosmic + smithay-client-toolkit rebuild — E.2 (layer-shell
anchor + strut), E.3 (foreign-toplevel listener), E.4 (sway IPC),
E.6 (brightness via brightnessctl), E.8 (Iced drawer with
layer-shell anchor + tween). The W1–W5 substeps stay as the
historical lock; live work tracks under Phase E.

- [✓] **W1 Layer-shell wallpaper + panel surface** — superseded by
  E.2 (cosmic-panel-anchor + libcosmic `auto_exclusive_zone_enable`).
- [✓] **W2 Foreign-toplevel dock** — superseded by E.3
  (`wlr_foreign_toplevel_management_v1` via SCTK).
- [✓] **W3 Window switching via foreign-toplevel** — superseded by
  E.4 (`swayipc-async::run_command` + EventStream).
- [✓] **W4 Global hotkeys via portal** — superseded by Phase D.5
  (sway config writer) + the `mackes-bindings.conf` flow that
  routes through `settings::keybinds` (A.1/C.8).
- [✓] **W5 Drawer slide animation via layer-shell** — superseded by
  E.8 (Iced drawer port with layer-shell anchor + tween).
- [✓] **W6 `mackes-maximizer` Wayland conditionalize** — moot
  per the 1.0.7 retirement of `mackes-maximizer.service`. The
  unit, binary, and autostart .desktop were all removed in the
  v8.8 i3-only directive, so there's no x11-only service left
  to gate. Confirmed in the 1.0.7 spec changelog and the
  `bin/mackes-wm` simplification.
- [✓] **W7 Replace `bin/mackes-wm` Wayland path** — `mackes-wm
  session-pick` lists every installed
  `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/*.desktop` + `xsessions/*.desktop`
  plus a one-line instruction: "log out + pick from the
  greeter's session dropdown." Shipping the wayland-session
  .desktop files for Sway / Hyprland is a packaging follow-up
  inside the eventual layer-shell port.
- [✓] **W8 Runtime probe** — `mackes-wm probe-wayland` reports
  `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `DISPLAY`, and
  layer-shell availability (via `wayland-info` if installed).
  Cheap enough to run from the panel's status cluster if we
  ever surface it there.

### Documentation + accessibility from `wayland-readiness.md`

- [✓] **Status-line "GNOME-shell on Wayland not supported"** —
  `docs/help/wayland.md` ships with a Status-line section explaining
  that GNOME-shell on Wayland has no `zwlr_foreign_toplevel_manager_v1`
  equivalent, so the dock tasklist surface is empty there. wlroots
  compositors (sway, Hyprland, river) will work once W1–W5 layer-shell
  port lands. Topic registered in
  `mackes/workbench/help.py::_TOPIC_ORDER` + `_TOPIC_LABELS` (between
  `kde-connect` and `presets`); linked from `docs/help/index.md`.

### MDE Files (Artifact Manager) — cosmic-files fork, Iced/Rust, mesh-first (locked 2026-05-19)

> **Scope correction (2026-05-19).** This block was originally drafted
> as a React/TypeScript plan targeting the MAP2 audio platform repo.
> Per user directive 2026-05-19 ("Build in Rust as discussed"), the
> primary track is now an **in-repo Rust crate at
> `crates/mde-files/`** that forks `pop-os/cosmic-files` and wears the
> "Artifact Manager" design from
> `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/`. The React/MAP2 surface stays a
> downstream port that can pull the same backend contract over HTTP
> when MAP2 needs a web UI; the Iced/Rust crate is what ships with
> MDE v2.0.0.

**Design contract (locked):** `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/design-spec.md`
(Rust implementation contract) +
`docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/upstream-bundle/Artifact-Manager.html`
(React prototype) +
`docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/upstream-bundle/chats/chat2.md`
(iteration history). Mesh is the home base, Downloads is the single
primary local pin, the rest of the local filesystem hides behind a
dashed "Browse filesystem…" disclosure that opens an explainer card.

**This-turn deliverables (2026-05-19):**
- [✓] `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/` — design source + Rust impl spec.
- [✓] `crates/mde-files/` registered in workspace `Cargo.toml`.
- [✓] Full data model (`Peer`, `SelfNode`, `FileRow`, `Mime`, `View`, `Layout`).
- [✓] Demo data (PEERS / SELF_NODE / RECENT_TRANSFERS / INBOX / DOWNLOADS / PINE_FILES / BIRCH_FILES / OAK_FILES / LOCAL_PINS / LOCAL_RECENT).
- [✓] Theme tokens (`theme.rs`) + 34 Lucide-style SVG icons (`icons.rs`).
- [✓] Iced 0.13 Application — titlebar, sidebar, toolbar, all 5 views (MeshOverview / PeerFolder / Inbox / Downloads / LocalVeil).
- [✓] State machine (View routing, Local disclosure toggle, layout, search).
- [✓] Unit tests — 15 passing covering data model, demo data, view routing.

**Hard rules (locked, do not relax without re-survey):**

**Hard rules (locked, do not relax without re-survey):**

1. **Backend = source of truth** for all file, node, mesh, transfer,
   audit, rollback, and deployment state. The UI never mutates a
   file directly — every action calls `mded` over D-Bus
   (`dev.mackes.MDE.Shell.*` / `dev.mackes.MDE.Fleet.*` per the MDE
   rebrand identifier table).
2. **Mesh-first layout (locked from `chat2.md`).** The sidebar's MESH
   section dominates (peers + inbox + outbox); the LOCAL section is
   pinned at the bottom with only `Downloads` as a first-class pin;
   the rest of the filesystem lives behind the dashed "Browse
   filesystem…" disclosure that opens the explainer card, not a flat
   folder. Default landing is `View::MeshOverview`.
3. **Lucide-style line icons only.** 24-grid, 1.6 px stroke,
   `currentColor`. The 34 icons in `icons.rs` are the complete set;
   adding a new icon means adding to `icons.rs` AND the design-spec
   icon registry (§9 of `design-spec.md`).
4. **GPLv3 hygiene.** Upstream `pop-os/cosmic-files` is GPL-3.0.
   The mde-files Cargo manifest already declares
   `license = "GPL-3.0-or-later"` via `workspace.package`; the merge
   phase below records the exact upstream commit SHA(s) consumed.
5. **Integrate with `mded`, don't duplicate.** Reuse the unified
   meta-daemon's settings store, fleet-config layer, audit log, and
   notifications surface. The crate's `Backend` trait gets a
   `Backend::DBus` impl that subscribes to the existing surfaces; no
   new daemon work is in scope here.

#### Phase 0 — Design lock + crate scaffolding (most landed 2026-05-19)

- [✓] **0.1 License path lock** — GPL-3.0-or-later, matching
  upstream `pop-os/cosmic-files`. Manifest inherits via
  `license.workspace = true`. Upstream attribution + commit SHA
  recorded as part of Phase 4.1 below.
- [ ] **0.2 Upstream pin** — Record the exact upstream
  cosmic-files commit SHA + tarball checksum in
  `docs/upstream/cosmic-files.md` when the merge starts (Phase 4).
- [✓] **0.3 Design source committed** —
  `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/README.md`,
  `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/design-spec.md` (Rust contract),
  `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/upstream-bundle/` (prototype HTML +
  chat transcripts + handoff README).
- [✓] **0.4 Crate scaffold** — `crates/mde-files/Cargo.toml` +
  workspace registration; module skeleton (`lib.rs` / `main.rs` /
  `model.rs` / `demo_data.rs` / `theme.rs` / `icons.rs` /
  `widgets.rs` / `views.rs` / `app.rs`); `cargo check -p mde-files`
  green; 15 unit tests passing.
- [✓] **0.5 Icon registry** — 34 Lucide-style SVG icons in
  `crates/mde-files/src/icons.rs` matching the prototype's `I`
  object 1:1. Test asserts every entry is a well-formed SVG document.
- [✓] **0.6 Design tokens** — PatternFly v6 + warm-dark amber-rust
  palette translated into typed `Color` constants in
  `crates/mde-files/src/theme.rs`; `theme()` returns a custom Iced
  `Theme`.

#### Phase 1 — Rust UI completeness (Iced/libcosmic surface)

- [✓] **1.1 State machine** — `View` enum (MeshOverview / Inbox /
  Peer(id) / Downloads / Local), `Message` reducer, disclosure
  toggle semantics ported from the prototype, unit-tested.
- [✓] **1.2 All five views render from demo data** — banner +
  peer-card grid + transfer log on MeshOverview; per-peer files
  table on PeerFolder; from-pills on Inbox; mixed pills on
  Downloads; explainer-card + pin-grid + recent-modified on
  LocalVeil.
- [ ] **1.3 Selection + multi-select model** — Track focused row
  + Shift/Ctrl multi-select; expose `Selected` for bulk actions.
- [ ] **1.4 Details panel** — Right-side panel showing metadata,
  permissions, mesh availability, operation history for the focused
  row. Hidden when nothing selected.
- [ ] **1.5 Context menu (right-click)** — Open in app, copy path,
  Send To submenu, delete, properties.
- [ ] **1.6 Drag-and-drop** — File rows drag onto sidebar peers →
  triggers `Backend::send_to(peer, mode=copy)`.
- [ ] **1.7 Operation drawer** — Slide-up panel showing live
  per-operation progress (one row per active op), cancel/retry/
  verify/rollback controls. Subscribes to backend op stream.
- [ ] **1.8 Search-results view** — When `search` is non-empty,
  switch the main pane to a results list filtered across the
  current scope (mesh / local depending on the active view).
- [ ] **1.9 Grid view** — `Layout::Grid` renders the current file
  list as a tile grid; metadata icon top + filename + origin pill
  bottom.

#### Phase 2 — `Backend` trait + `mded` D-Bus impl

- [ ] **2.1 `Backend` trait** — `crates/mde-files/src/backend.rs`:
  `async list_peers() -> Vec<Peer>`, `list_inbox() -> Vec<FileRow>`,
  `list_downloads() -> Vec<FileRow>`,
  `list_peer_files(peer_id) -> Vec<FileRow>`,
  `send_file(peer, path, mode, conflict)`,
  `subscribe_progress() -> impl Stream<Item = OpEvent>`.
- [ ] **2.2 `Backend::Demo` impl** — Wraps the existing const
  arrays. Used by `cargo run` + tests.
- [ ] **2.3 `Backend::DBus` impl** — Talks to
  `dev.mackes.MDE.Fleet.{Peers,Files}` and
  `dev.mackes.MDE.Shell.{Inbox,Outbox,Downloads,FileOperations}`.
  zbus 5 with `tokio` feature (matches the v2.0.0 stack lock).
- [ ] **2.4 mded surfaces** — Land the matching D-Bus surfaces in
  `crates/mackesd/src/ipc/shell.rs` and `…/fleet.rs`. Blocks on
  Phase A.3 of v2.0.0 Mackes DE.
- [ ] **2.5 Path safety + allowed-roots resolver** — In `mded`
  (not in the UI). Canonicalize, symlink-resolve, reject traversal,
  reject anything outside the RBAC-allowed roots.
- [ ] **2.6 Operation orchestrator** — In `mded`. Issues
  `operation_id` + `audit_id`, drives validate → execute → verify
  state machine, persists each step, emits progress events.
- [ ] **2.7 Audit + rollback store** — `audit_log` table in
  mded's SQLite (migration 0003). Before-state snapshot, transfer
  manifest, checksum proofs (BLAKE3 + SHA-256 dual-hash),
  replayable rollback plan.
- [ ] **2.8 Mesh reconciler hook** — Completed ops feed the v12.0
  desired/actual reconciler; raise drift on partial failure.

#### Phase 3 — Send-To matrix (first-class verb)

- [ ] **3.1 Send-To entry points** — Available from **toolbar,
  context menu, command palette, drag-drop, details panel, and
  bulk-select bar**. Six entry points; all dispatch through the
  same `Message::SendTo(SendToRequest)`.
- [ ] **3.2 Destinations** — `peer`, `peer_group`, `role`, `site`,
  `region`, `all_peers`, `policy_target`, `asset_library`,
  `snapshot_bundle`, `backup_store`, `deployment_staging`,
  `remote_working_directory`. Each renders a typed
  destination-picker subview.
- [ ] **3.3 Modes** — `copy`, `move`, `sync`, `deploy`, `stage`,
  `collect`, `broadcast`, `replicate`. Mode picker carries an
  inline explainer for each mode.
- [ ] **3.4 Conflict policies** — `ask`, `skip`, `overwrite`,
  `keep_both`, `newest`, `checksum`, `merge`, `fail_safely`.
  Persisted per-destination-class as a user pref.
- [ ] **3.5 Pre-flight validation** — Source / target /
  permissions / allowed-paths / disk-space / node-reachability /
  file-type policy / rollback-feasibility, each surfaced as a
  pre-flight check row in the Send-To dialog. Any failed check
  blocks send.

#### Phase 4 — cosmic-files upstream merge

- [ ] **4.1 Pin upstream** — Snapshot the cosmic-files commit SHA
  + tarball SHA into `docs/upstream/cosmic-files.md`; add
  `LICENSES/COSMIC-FILES.md` with upstream copyright + license text.
- [ ] **4.2 Vendor relevant modules** — `cosmic-files/src/tab.rs`
  (file-list rendering primitives), `mod.rs` mime sniffing, the
  trash adapter. Vendor under `crates/mde-files/src/upstream/`
  with a top-of-file attribution comment per file.
- [ ] **4.3 Bridge the data model** — Map upstream `Item`
  (cosmic-files) ↔ our `FileRow`; map upstream `Tab` ↔ our `View`.
  Keep our types as the public surface; upstream stays internal.
- [ ] **4.4 Replace upstream sidebar + landing** — Our mesh-first
  sidebar and `MeshOverview` view replace upstream's "Recents /
  Home / etc." surface. The local pins veil is our addition.
- [ ] **4.5 Drop unused upstream features** — Cosmic-Config
  user-prefs, Pop! shell integration, anything tied to the COSMIC
  panel. We use Iced + libcosmic but not the COSMIC desktop bits.

#### Phase 5 — Polish + accessibility

- [ ] **5.1 Keyboard navigation** — Tab moves between toolbar /
  sidebar / list; arrow keys move selection within a list; Enter
  opens; Backspace navigates up; Cmd/Ctrl-F focuses search.
- [ ] **5.2 Focus rings** — Visible focus indicators on every
  interactive element (PatternFly v6 focus token).
- [ ] **5.3 Screen-reader labels** — `accessibility_label` on
  every icon-only button (Iced 0.13 supports this via `Element`
  metadata).
- [ ] **5.4 RTL layout** — Sidebar flips right; chevrons mirror.
- [ ] **5.5 Reduced motion** — Skip the transfer-progress sweep
  animation when `prefers-reduced-motion` is detected via cosmic-
  config.

#### Phase 6 — Tests + acceptance

- [✓] **6.1 Data-model unit tests** — 15 tests covering
  fmt_count thresholds, latency buckets, View routing,
  FileRow origin, peer-files lookup, demo-data totals, SVG envelope.
- [ ] **6.2 Backend tests** — `Backend::Demo` round-trips +
  `Backend::DBus` integration tests behind `#[cfg(feature = "dbus-test")]`.
- [ ] **6.3 Send-To matrix tests** — Property-style test
  exercising every (destination × mode × conflict-policy) triple
  against a stubbed `Backend`, asserting the right preconditions
  are validated and the right zbus method is invoked.
- [ ] **6.4 Snapshot tests** — Render every view to a PNG and
  diff against committed snapshots. Helps catch unintended visual
  regressions during the cosmic-files merge.
- [ ] **6.5 Acceptance scenario** — User right-clicks a file,
  picks **Send To → Audio Nodes**; mded validates, transfers,
  verifies checksum, shows per-peer progress, writes audit trail,
  updates mesh state, offers rollback. End-to-end test green
  against an in-process mded.

#### Phase 7 — Downstream MAP2 (optional, deferred)

- [ ] **7.1 If MAP2 needs a web UI**, port the same design + data
  model to React via the cross-repo path originally drafted in
  this section's earlier revision: backend services at
  `app/services/filemanager/`, REST + WebSocket surfaces at
  `/api/v1/filemanager/*` + `/api/v1/mesh/file-operations/*`,
  React UI at `web/src/app/components/FileManager/` with a Carbon-
  icon registry. **This was the original plan**; redirected here
  to Rust per 2026-05-19 directive. The web port stays out-of-scope
  until MAP2 asks for it explicitly.

**Definition of Done for this plan:** every Phase 0–6 item moves
to `[✓] Done`, the acceptance scenario passes, snapshot tests are
green in CI, and the cosmic-files merge attribution is committed
under `LICENSES/`.

## History — shipped 1.0.6 through 1.1.0

(unchanged from the prior consolidation — see git for the full
release notes)

### 1.0.6 (2026-05-18) — first-boot panel polish

Phase 8.5.1–8.5.5 in full. Carbon icon recolor at load, dock
auto-sizing, 12-hour clock + weather popover, status-cluster
review popovers, `_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL` on both surfaces. Phase
10.1 + 10.3–10.5 (RPM rename, brand surfacing, CHANGELOG, cut
release).

### 1.0.7 (2026-05-19) — plank dock + i3 switch + status cluster

Phase 8.6.1–8.6.10 in full (Plank-parity dock with pinned
launchers + tasklist, i3 WM switcher, About Mackes window, drawer
live-data wiring pass, drawer hold/release fix, non-blocking
sidebar status refresh, `python3 -P` wrapper, strut
height-tracking poll, status cluster icon+numeric live
indicators). Phase 8.7.1–8.7.6 (top-bar window buttons —
subsequently retired in 1.1.0). Phase 8.8.1–8.8.8 (xfwm4 fully
replaced by i3; mackes-maximizer retired; `mackes-wm`
status+reset; `apply_enforce_i3` birthright step). Phase 11.1
(AppStream metainfo), 11.2 partial (status-cluster a11y), 11.3
(Wayland-readiness audit), 11.4 (keyboard-shortcuts catalog),
11.6 partial (README pass), 11.7 (pytest smoke baseline), 11.8
(GSettings decision: not shipping), 11.9 (`async_probe` +
9 conversions). Phase 12.1.1 + 12.2.1 (mackesd scaffold + SQLite
schema). Phase 10.6.1–10.6.5 + 10.6.7 (panel-swap + workspaces +
panel archive). Phases 3.1–3.5, 4.2, 5.1, 5.3–5.6, 6.3, 7.1–7.3
(all shipped in prior tags — flipped here).

### 1.0.8 (2026-05-19) — first-boot hotfix

`mackes-enforce-session` autostart converges every login onto i3
+ mackes-panel (no xfwm4, no xfce4-panel, no xfdesktop).
WorkbenchWindow WM_CLASS pinned to `Mackes-shell` + i3 float
rule. Status-cluster click target locked to `mackes --focus
<slug>` (supersedes v3.0.0 Q28).

### 1.1.0 (2026-05-19) — Win10 layout

Top bar + Plank dock retired in favor of a single 40 px bottom
taskbar (supersedes v3.0.0 §4). Layout: Start
(`apple_menu_button`) + pinned apps · focused-app hero (i3-IPC
subscribe + 280 ms GTK revealer slide) · centered i3 cluster
(SPLIT / LAYOUT / WINDOW chips, no workspace switcher) ·
NetworkManager tray icon · status cluster · two-line clock.
Right-click Start drops a 9-item Fedora admin menu via terminator
(Root Terminal / DNF / journalctl / systemctl / SELinux /
firewall / disk-clean). Left-click Start opens a new Rust
popover (`start_menu.rs`) mirroring the drawer's Quick Actions +
Toggles + Volume + 7-step Brightness sections (supersedes v3.0.0
§5). `window_buttons.rs` retired (i3 keybinds + CSD
carry it). Win10-style watermark in the lower-right showing
version + build hash + Fedora release + hostname when DNF has
updates pending (4 h poll). Carbon-themed logout dialog replaces
the xfce4-session-logout window. Carbon icon mapper popover on
every dock app right-click, writing XDG-spec user overrides to
`~/.local/share/applications/`. Clipboard manager popover on the
clipboard tray icon, backed by the mesh-replicated
`~/.cache/mackes/clipboard.json`. `mackes-clipboard-daemon`
auto-enables via a new systemd user-preset (`90-mackes.preset`).
XDG user-dirs remapped via `apply_user_dirs` birthright step to
`~/QNM-Mesh/` for the shared media folders and `~/Downloads`
local. XFCE menu hides expanded from 18 entries to 32,
propagated to existing users on every login via
`mackes-enforce-session`. `mackes update` CLI subcommand +
`.repo` file tuned to Fedora best practice. 5 i3 gaps profiles
via `mackes/i3_gaps.py` + Workbench picker. New CI gate
`tests/test_panel_xvfb_smoke.py` under Xvfb. Phase 8.7.x retired
in favor of i3-native chrome.

## How to add a task

Add new entries under **Active** with this shape:

```markdown
- [ ] **<release-tag>: short title** — one or two sentences of
  acceptance criteria + dependencies + estimated effort. Link to a
  design doc if the lock context is non-trivial.
```

Move to `[>] In Progress` when you start substantive work,
`[✓] Done` once Definition of Done (`.claude/CLAUDE.md` §0.8) is
satisfied, `[!] Blocked` with a one-line reason if external state
stalls it. **Don't use `[~] Deferred`** — per current directive,
items are either Active, Done, or Blocked. When a newer directive
contradicts an earlier design-doc lock, the newer one wins silently
— update the affected worklist items in place; don't track the
contradiction separately.

When a task is `[✓] Done`, leave it in **Active** until the release
that contains it ships, then move it to the **History** section
with a one-line summary under the matching release tag.
