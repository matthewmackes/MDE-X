//! v2.0.0 Phase A.2 (locked 2026-05-19) — in-process worker pool.
//!
//! The unified backend folds 8 standalone Python daemons (and one
//! Rust bridge) into a single `mackesd` process. Each former-daemon
//! becomes a [`Worker`] task driven by [`Supervisor`]. Worker bodies
//! land in Phase B; this module ships the trait surface, the shutdown
//! plumbing, and the per-worker join semantics every Phase B worker
//! will share.
//!
//! Design choices (locked via the 2026 stack survey 2026-05-19):
//!
//! * **Async runtime: tokio** (full features). The legacy reconcile
//!   loop (`crate::worker`) keeps its `std::thread` model — they
//!   coexist by living in separate scheduler domains.
//! * **Per-worker future: native `async fn` via `async_trait`**.
//!   Object-safety matters because the supervisor stores
//!   `Box<dyn Worker>`; native async-fn-in-trait drops object safety,
//!   so we keep `async_trait` for this trait only.
//! * **Restart policy: Erlang OTP-ish**. Phase B layers the
//!   `task-supervisor` crate (already a dep) on top of this trait so
//!   each worker gets per-task restart back-off + health-tick
//!   semantics. Phase A ships only the *contract*; the supervisor
//!   here is the minimal "spawn-and-shutdown" version.
//!
//! All public types are gated behind the `async-services` feature so
//! a fresh checkout that only builds the sync read-API doesn't pull
//! tokio into its dep tree.
